In the first book, the Queen would often exclaim, “Off with his head” to numerous different characters. This is a clear cut reference to Queen Margaret’s famous quote, “Off with the crown, and, with the crown, his head.” The prolonged wars between the two houses vying for power after the 100 year war was characterized by equal matchup and nearly even wins. This is clearly characterized by the fight between the red and white knights during Through the Looking Glass in the quote, “One Rule seems to be that if one Knight hits another he knocks him off his horse, and if he misses he tumbles off himself.” This political allusion would be well known to the adult audiences of the book, as they would have a decent understanding of the history of their own nation, but the topic is too advanced to have been commonly taught during the younger grades, the primary audience of Alice in Wonderland. Therefore, the political allusion must be directed towards the older audiences of the book, who would have been educated enough to recognize the historical allusions.\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026quot;In conclusion, Lewis Carroll definitely uses historical allusions in his novels as a means to entertain older audiences. This is clear as the topics of these allusions are complicated enough that they would not be understood by the younger children who are the primary audience simply because they had not yet been educated enough to understand them.\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eListen, look up, speak up.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRef: Sifting Truths (aka \u003ccode\u003egreek_stuff.md\u003c/code\u003e), \u003ca href=\"1f3ea7fa44dfe6cdb940bc4301b4ba2578a3ad0d\"\u003eDec 20, 2022\u003c/a\u003e \u0026amp; \u003ca href=\"https://mastodon.social/@johnandersen777/109554008204658963\"\u003emastodon.social Alice Thread\u003c/a\u003e (riddle warning, security by obscurity was in effect at this point)\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRevelations can be good, so long as we use them to prepare and unite instead of previous proliferated revelations from organized religions who's aim is to save only a few.

Through various channels—politics, media, and even certain aspects of organized religion—these forces create distractions that hinder humanity's ability to unite. This disunity prevents us from effectively addressing significant environmental and societal challenges. The ultimate aim of these divisive strategies appears to be the obscuring of truth, isolating individuals, and perpetuating passivity and disempowerment among the masses.</p><p>At the core of this division lies an age-old conflict between the forces of love and unity, epitomized by teachings that encourage compassion and cooperation, and the forces of fear and deception. As we confront the complex issues of our time—including natural phenomena like pole shifts and their wide-ranging impacts—the influence of deceptive forces seems to grow stronger. Yet, these forces can be overcome if we collectively embrace messages of unity and focus on building resilience.</p><h3 id=the-scientific-perspective-understanding-pole-shifts-and-their-impacts>The Scientific Perspective: Understanding Pole Shifts and Their Impacts</h3><blockquote><p>"Perhaps we need some outside, universal threat to make us recognize this common bond. I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world."</p><p>[<a href=https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/address-42d-session-united-nations-general-assembly-new-york-new-york>President Ronald Reagan</a>]</p></blockquote><p>From a scientific standpoint, it's essential to understand the phenomenon of geomagnetic pole shifts and their potential effects on our world. The Earth's magnetic field is generated by the movement of molten iron in its outer core, creating a magnetic field that extends into space and shields the planet from solar radiation.</p><p><strong>What Are Pole Shifts?</strong></p><blockquote><p>The Next Cataclysm</p><p>Like Noah’s,</p><p>6,500 years ago . . . .</p><p>Like Adam and Eve’s,</p><p>11,500 years ago . . . .</p><p>This, too,</p><p>will come to pass . . . .</p></blockquote><p>Geomagnetic pole shifts refer to changes in the Earth's magnetic field where the positions of magnetic north and magnetic south can move significantly or even swap places over geological timescales. Evidence from rock formations shows that such reversals have occurred multiple times throughout Earth's history.</p><p><strong>Potential Impacts of Pole Shifts</strong></p><blockquote><p>So, apparently once every few thousand years neutral matter escapes from the 860-mile-radius inner core into the thick molten outer core, and there is a literal atomic explosion inside the Earth. The explosion in the high energy layer of the outer core disrupts completely the electrical and magnetic structure in both the molten outer core and the outer 6o-mile thick molten layer. Finally the ice caps are allowed to pull the shell of the earth around the interior, with the shallow molten layer lubricating the shift all the way.</p></blockquote><p>While pole shifts are natural events, their impacts on modern society could be significant due to our reliance on technology and infrastructure sensitive to magnetic fields:</p><ul><li><strong>Navigation Systems:</strong> Many navigation systems, including compasses used in aviation and maritime activities, rely on the Earth's magnetic field. Significant shifts could necessitate recalibrations to maintain accuracy.</li><li><strong>Satellite and Communication Systems:</strong> Variations in the magnetic field can affect satellite operations and communication networks, potentially leading to disruptions.</li><li><strong>Radiation Exposure:</strong> A weakened magnetic field during a pole shift could result in increased exposure to solar and cosmic radiation, affecting both human health and electronic systems.</li></ul><p><strong>The Importance of Preparation</strong></p><blockquote><p>Once more the earth has shifted its 6-mile thick shell, with the poles moving almost to the equator in a fraction of a day. Again the atmosphere and oceans, refusing to change direction with the earth’s shell, have wiped out almost all life.</p></blockquote><p>Understanding these potential impacts underscores the need for proactive measures. By investing in research and monitoring of geomagnetic activity, we can better predict changes and implement strategies to mitigate adverse effects. This preparation involves enhancing the resilience of technological systems and updating protocols for navigation and communication.</p><h3 id=the-spiritual-perspective-overcoming-division-through-unity>The Spiritual Perspective: Overcoming Division Through Unity</h3><blockquote><p>After this tumble we join Noah, Adam and Eve, Atlantis, Mu, and Olympus - and Deum Jesum Christum joins Osiris, Ta’aroa, Zeus, and Vishnu.</p><p>Noah? Adam and Eve? Vishnu? Osiris? What do they have in common? They represent erass apart and yet, somehow, they all join hands in the next cataclysm, and walk with us.</p><p>Yes, Noah, Adam and Eve, Osiris, Ta’aroa, Zeus, and Vishnu have much deeper meanings now; and, as they join hands and walk with us, we hear Adam and Eve saying: "Listen - for now we can truly share our story with, you."</p></blockquote><p>On a spiritual level, overcoming the forces of deception and division requires a return to principles that emphasize unity, compassion, and understanding. Throughout history, spiritual leaders have taught the importance of these values in building harmonious societies.</p><p><strong>Embracing Shared Humanity</strong></p><p>Recognizing our shared humanity is a fundamental step toward unity. By acknowledging that we are all interconnected, we can transcend the barriers of race, religion, nationality, and ideology. This perspective fosters empathy and reduces conflicts born out of misunderstanding or fear.</p><p><strong>The Role of Compassion and Love</strong></p><p>Compassion and love are powerful tools in countering deception and division. When individuals act with kindness and consideration for others, it creates a ripple effect that strengthens community bonds. These values encourage cooperation and collective action toward common goals.</p><p><strong>Overcoming Fear and Misinformation</strong></p><p>Deceptive forces often exploit fear and spread misinformation to create division. By promoting education, critical thinking, and open dialogue, communities can become more resilient against such tactics. Encouraging individuals to seek truth and question misleading narratives empowers them to make informed decisions.</p><h3 id=building-decentralized-resilience>Building Decentralized Resilience</h3><p>In light of both scientific and spiritual insights, building decentralized resilience emerges as a practical and philosophical approach to addressing global challenges. Decentralization involves distributing resources, decision-making, and responsibilities across various levels rather than centralizing them.</p><p><strong>Benefits of Decentralization</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Enhanced Adaptability:</strong> Decentralized systems can respond more quickly to local needs and changes, making them more adaptable in the face of disruptions.</li><li><strong>Reduced Vulnerabilities:</strong> By avoiding reliance on a single point of control, decentralized systems are less susceptible to widespread failures.</li><li><strong>Empowered Communities:</strong> Localized control empowers communities to take charge of their development and resilience strategies.</li></ul><p><strong>Strategies for Implementation</strong></p><p><strong>1. Localized Energy Solutions</strong></p><p>Promoting renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power at the community level reduces dependence on centralized grids. Microgrids and community-owned energy projects enhance energy security and sustainability.</p><p><strong>2. Community-Centric Agriculture</strong></p><p>Developing local food systems through urban farming, community gardens, and support for local farmers increases food security. It also fosters community engagement and sustainable agricultural practices.</p><p><strong>3. Decentralized Communication Networks</strong></p><p>Establishing local communication infrastructures like mesh networks ensures connectivity even when larger networks are disrupted. This is crucial for emergency response and maintaining social cohesion during crises.</p><p><strong>4. Education and Knowledge Sharing</strong></p><p>Creating platforms for sharing knowledge and skills strengthens community resilience. Educational programs focused on emergency preparedness, sustainability, and technological literacy empower individuals.</p><p><strong>5. Collaborative Governance</strong></p><p>Encouraging participatory decision-making processes allows communities to have a direct say in policies and initiatives that affect them. This inclusivity enhances the relevance and effectiveness of resilience strategies.</p><h3 id=unity-and-resilience-for-a-sustainable-future>Unity and Resilience for a Sustainable Future</h3><p>The challenges posed by phenomena like pole shifts and the forces of deception and division require a concerted effort to build a resilient and unified society. By integrating scientific understanding with spiritual principles of unity and compassion, we can develop holistic approaches to these challenges.</p><p><strong>Action Steps Forward</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Foster Unity:</strong> Embrace values that promote understanding and cooperation across different segments of society.</li><li><strong>Enhance Resilience:</strong> Invest in decentralized systems that empower communities and reduce vulnerabilities.</li><li><strong>Promote Education:</strong> Encourage learning and critical thinking to combat misinformation and prepare for future challenges.</li><li><strong>Engage Collaboratively:</strong> Work together across disciplines, sectors, and borders to develop comprehensive solutions.</li></ul><p>The time to act is now.

By delving deep into our moral values and examining the root causes of global issues, we may find a pathway toward a common framework—a self-organized system of shared principles and values that emerges organically from collective introspection and cooperation.</p><h3 id=the-power-of-self-reflection-on-moral-values>The Power of Self-Reflection on Moral Values</h3><p>Every individual possesses a moral compass, shaped by personal experiences, culture, and an innate sense of right and wrong. When we take the time to reflect on these values, we often discover that, despite superficial differences, there is significant overlap in what we consider just and equitable. This common ground is the foundation upon which a self-organized framework can be built.</p><p>By identifying and addressing the root causes of societal issues—such as inequality, injustice, and environmental degradation—we move beyond treating symptoms and start fostering genuine change. This process requires honesty, openness, and a willingness to challenge our own beliefs and biases.</p><h3 id=collective-alignment-through-cooperative-principles>Collective Alignment Through Cooperative Principles</h3><p>By embracing principles that promote voluntary cooperation and mutual aid, we empower communities to:</p><ul><li><strong>Shed Deception</strong>: Transparency becomes paramount. With open communication channels, information flows freely, reducing the capacity for manipulation.</li><li><strong>Reduce Human Error</strong>: Collaborative efforts and community-based checks and balances help mitigate the impact of individual mistakes.</li><li><strong>Combat Manipulation</strong>: Decentralized decision-making minimizes the influence of those who might seek to exploit systems for personal gain.</li></ul><p>Through these means, we align on common goals—such as sustainability, equity, and peace—by fostering environments where everyone's voice contributes to the collective direction.</p><h3 id=bridging-the-symbolic-to-subsymbolic-gap>Bridging the Symbolic to Subsymbolic Gap</h3><p>Much of the misunderstanding in the world arises from symbolic representations—language, rituals, and cultural artifacts—that differ across societies. These symbols can create barriers when taken at face value without understanding the underlying subsymbolic meanings—the fundamental human experiences and emotions they represent.</p><p>To bridge this gap:</p><ul><li><strong>Encourage Empathetic Communication</strong>: Strive to understand others' perspectives beyond their words or symbols.</li><li><strong>Focus on Shared Human Experiences</strong>: Acknowledge that, at a subsymbolic level, we all experience love, fear, joy, and sorrow similarly.</li><li><strong>Promote Cultural Exchange</strong>: Engaging with diverse cultures demystifies symbols and reduces prejudices.</li></ul><p>By doing so, we peel back the layers that superficially divide us, revealing the common humanity that binds us all.</p><h3 id=self-organization>Self-Organization</h3><p>Creating a self-organized framework rooted in shared moral values offers a pathway toward unity and understanding. By collectively shedding deception, reducing human error, and bridging symbolic divides, we can work together to address the root causes of the world's issues. This collaborative approach doesn't require a central authority but thrives on the active participation and alignment of individuals committed to common goals. In embracing this model, we take meaningful steps toward a more harmonious and equitable world.</p><h2 id=harnessing-supply-chain-transparency-and-ai-for-global-resilience>Harnessing Supply Chain Transparency and AI for Global Resilience</h2><blockquote><p>Probably the most sensible way in which the new nations can improve their lot is by forming federations: getting together to face common problems and opportunities while maintaining a healthy measure of separate identity. Economic federation is certainly the most promising form at the moment, despite some early failures. What English Economist Barbara Ward calls "technocratic federations" are likely to sprout in the future——and the young nations should begin planning how and when they can form and join them. This would happily preserve their proud national prerogatives while offering the benefits of a large economic mass and a sharing of modern technology.</p></blockquote><p>In an era where humanity faces unprecedented challenges, ranging from environmental crises to technological disruptions, the robustness of our global supply chains has never been more critical. The intricate networks that deliver goods and services across the world are the lifelines of modern society. Ensuring their transparency and resilience is paramount to preparing for and mitigating potential mass extinction events or other existential threats. By integrating advanced software supply chain frameworks, leveraging federation as a general eventing mechanism, and employing artificial intelligence (AI) alongside policy engines, we can create a transparent, robust supply chain infrastructure. This infrastructure will not only enhance our preparedness but also pave the way for a future where diversity and innovation drive us into a new golden era.</p><h3 id=the-imperative-for-transparency>The Imperative for Transparency</h3><p>Supply chains today are complex, multi-tiered systems involving countless stakeholders across the globe. This complexity often leads to a lack of visibility, making it difficult to identify vulnerabilities, inefficiencies, or potential points of failure. Transparency in supply chains is not merely a matter of operational efficiency; it is a strategic necessity for global resilience.</p><ul><li><strong>Understanding Dependencies</strong>: Transparent supply chains allow us to map out dependencies at every level—global, national, regional, local, and individual entities. This mapping is crucial for identifying critical nodes whose failure could cascade into widespread disruption.</li><li><strong>Risk Assessment and Mitigation</strong>: With full visibility, organizations can conduct comprehensive risk assessments, identifying areas susceptible to threats such as resource shortages, logistical bottlenecks, or cybersecurity breaches.</li><li><strong>Regulatory Compliance and Ethical Standards</strong>: Transparency ensures adherence to regulatory requirements and ethical standards, fostering trust among stakeholders and consumers.</li></ul><h3 id=integrating-advanced-software-supply-chain-frameworks>Integrating Advanced Software Supply Chain Frameworks</h3><p>To achieve this level of transparency, we must employ sophisticated software supply chain frameworks that can handle the complexity and scale of modern networks.</p><ul><li><strong>Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT)</strong>: Technologies like blockchain offer immutable records of transactions and movements within the supply chain, enhancing traceability and accountability.</li><li><strong>Internet of Things (IoT) Integration</strong>: IoT devices can provide real-time data on the condition and location of goods, feeding into centralized platforms for monitoring and analysis.</li><li><strong>Data Standardization Protocols</strong>: Implementing universal data standards ensures that information can be seamlessly shared and interpreted across different systems and organizations.</li></ul><h3 id=federation-as-a-general-eventing-mechanism>Federation as a General Eventing Mechanism</h3><p>Federation refers to the interlinking of disparate systems and organizations to operate cohesively without a central controlling authority.

While the idea of good and bad is understood by the small children, they are unable to grasp the more complicated political undertone of the section. The novel was published in 1865. The adults who were a reading the book at the time period, would have easily noticed the connections to the the February Revolutions happening in nearby France in which corrupted court systems were used by the king of France to crush out the rebellion. In France, the king would use his power to act as the judge himself, to make sure that his will was always carried out, an exact replica which is done in Alice in Wonderland by the king and queen."</p><ul><li><blockquote><p>“’Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?’ asked another of the jurymen. ‘No, they’re not,’ said the White Rabbit, ‘and that’s the queerest thing about it.’ (The jury all looked puzzled.) ‘He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,’ said the King. (The jury all brightened up again.) ‘Please your Majesty,’ said the Knave, ‘I didn’t write it, and they can’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.’ ‘If you didn’t sign it,’ said the King, ‘that only makes the matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed your name like an honest man.’ There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day. ‘That PROVES his guilt,’ said the Queen.”</p></blockquote></li></ul><p>"In this example from the book, the king and queen are able to manipulate the truth however they want and no one is able to question them because of their power. This sort of historical allusion would be near impossible for the young children of the time to understand as many of them were not even born during the February Revolutions!"</p><p>"In Through the Looking Glass, the war is during a chess game between Red and White, as opposed to the traditional Black and White. Upon further examination, it turns out that there is actually deeper meaning behind the choice of colours. This is a direct political allusion to yet another series of wars, not so close timewise, but in Carroll’s own home country of England. During the war, the white roses represented the House of York while the red roses represented the House of Lancaster. In the first book, the Queen would often exclaim, “Off with his head” to numerous different characters. This is a clear cut reference to Queen Margaret’s famous quote, “Off with the crown, and, with the crown, his head.” The prolonged wars between the two houses vying for power after the 100 year war was characterized by equal matchup and nearly even wins. This is clearly characterized by the fight between the red and white knights during Through the Looking Glass in the quote, “One Rule seems to be that if one Knight hits another he knocks him off his horse, and if he misses he tumbles off himself.” This political allusion would be well known to the adult audiences of the book, as they would have a decent understanding of the history of their own nation, but the topic is too advanced to have been commonly taught during the younger grades, the primary audience of Alice in Wonderland. Therefore, the political allusion must be directed towards the older audiences of the book, who would have been educated enough to recognize the historical allusions."</p><p>"In conclusion, Lewis Carroll definitely uses historical allusions in his novels as a means to entertain older audiences. This is clear as the topics of these allusions are complicated enough that they would not be understood by the younger children who are the primary audience simply because they had not yet been educated enough to understand them."</p></blockquote><ul><li>Listen, look up, speak up.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Ref: Sifting Truths (aka <code>greek_stuff.md</code>), <a href=1f3ea7fa44dfe6cdb940bc4301b4ba2578a3ad0d>Dec 20, 2022</a> & <a href=https://mastodon.social/@johnandersen777/109554008204658963>mastodon.social Alice Thread</a> (riddle warning, security by obscurity was in effect at this point)<ul><li>Revelations can be good, so long as we use them to prepare and unite instead of previous proliferated revelations from organized religions who's aim is to save only a few.
