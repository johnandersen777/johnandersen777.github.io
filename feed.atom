<p>In our rapidly changing world, the forces of deception and division are increasingly active. Through various channels—politics, media, and even certain aspects of organized religion—these forces create distractions that hinder humanity's ability to unite. This disunity prevents us from effectively addressing significant environmental and societal challenges. The ultimate aim of these divisive strategies appears to be the obscuring of truth, isolating individuals, and perpetuating passivity and disempowerment among the masses.</p>
<p>At the core of this division lies an age-old conflict between the forces of love and unity, epitomized by teachings that encourage compassion and cooperation, and the forces of fear and deception. As we confront the complex issues of our time—including natural phenomena like pole shifts and their wide-ranging impacts—the influence of deceptive forces seems to grow stronger. Yet, these forces can be overcome if we collectively embrace messages of unity and focus on building resilience.</p>
<h3 id="the-scientific-perspective-understanding-pole-shifts-and-their-impacts">The Scientific Perspective: Understanding Pole Shifts and Their Impacts</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Perhaps we need some outside, universal threat to make us recognize this common bond. I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world.&quot;</p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/address-42d-session-united-nations-general-assembly-new-york-new-york">President Ronald Reagan</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a scientific standpoint, it's essential to understand the phenomenon of geomagnetic pole shifts and their potential effects on our world. The Earth's magnetic field is generated by the movement of molten iron in its outer core, creating a magnetic field that extends into space and shields the planet from solar radiation.</p>
<p><strong>What Are Pole Shifts?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Next Cataclysm</p>
<p>Like Noah’s,</p>
<p>6,500 years ago . . . .</p>
<p>Like Adam and Eve’s,</p>
<p>11,500 years ago . . . .</p>
<p>This, too,</p>
<p>will come to pass . . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Geomagnetic pole shifts refer to changes in the Earth's magnetic field where the positions of magnetic north and magnetic south can move significantly or even swap places over geological timescales. Evidence from rock formations shows that such reversals have occurred multiple times throughout Earth's history.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Impacts of Pole Shifts</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, apparently once every few thousand years neutral matter escapes from the 860-mile-radius inner core into the thick molten outer core, and there is a literal atomic explosion inside the Earth. The explosion in the high energy layer of the outer core disrupts completely the electrical and magnetic structure in both the molten outer core and the outer 6o-mile thick molten layer. Finally the ice caps are allowed to pull the shell of the earth around the interior, with the shallow molten layer lubricating the shift all the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While pole shifts are natural events, their impacts on modern society could be significant due to our reliance on technology and infrastructure sensitive to magnetic fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Navigation Systems:</strong> Many navigation systems, including compasses used in aviation and maritime activities, rely on the Earth's magnetic field. Significant shifts could necessitate recalibrations to maintain accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>Satellite and Communication Systems:</strong> Variations in the magnetic field can affect satellite operations and communication networks, potentially leading to disruptions.</li>
<li><strong>Radiation Exposure:</strong> A weakened magnetic field during a pole shift could result in increased exposure to solar and cosmic radiation, affecting both human health and electronic systems.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Importance of Preparation</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once more the earth has shifted its 6-mile thick shell, with the poles moving almost to the equator in a fraction of a day. Again the atmosphere and oceans, refusing to change direction with the earth’s shell, have wiped out almost all life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understanding these potential impacts underscores the need for proactive measures. By investing in research and monitoring of geomagnetic activity, we can better predict changes and implement strategies to mitigate adverse effects. This preparation involves enhancing the resilience of technological systems and updating protocols for navigation and communication.</p>
<h3 id="the-spiritual-perspective-overcoming-division-through-unity">The Spiritual Perspective: Overcoming Division Through Unity</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>After this tumble we join Noah, Adam and Eve, Atlantis, Mu, and Olympus - and Deum Jesum Christum joins Osiris, Ta’aroa, Zeus, and Vishnu.</p>
<p>Noah? Adam and Eve? Vishnu? Osiris? What do they have in common? They represent erass apart and yet, somehow, they all join hands in the next cataclysm, and walk with us.</p>
<p>Yes, Noah, Adam and Eve, Osiris, Ta’aroa, Zeus, and Vishnu have much deeper meanings now; and, as they join hands and walk with us, we hear Adam and Eve saying: &quot;Listen - for now we can truly share our story with, you.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a spiritual level, overcoming the forces of deception and division requires a return to principles that emphasize unity, compassion, and understanding. Throughout history, spiritual leaders have taught the importance of these values in building harmonious societies.</p>
<p><strong>Embracing Shared Humanity</strong></p>
<p>Recognizing our shared humanity is a fundamental step toward unity. By acknowledging that we are all interconnected, we can transcend the barriers of race, religion, nationality, and ideology. This perspective fosters empathy and reduces conflicts born out of misunderstanding or fear.</p>
<p><strong>The Role of Compassion and Love</strong></p>
<p>Compassion and love are powerful tools in countering deception and division. When individuals act with kindness and consideration for others, it creates a ripple effect that strengthens community bonds. These values encourage cooperation and collective action toward common goals.</p>
<p><strong>Overcoming Fear and Misinformation</strong></p>
<p>Deceptive forces often exploit fear and spread misinformation to create division. By promoting education, critical thinking, and open dialogue, communities can become more resilient against such tactics. Encouraging individuals to seek truth and question misleading narratives empowers them to make informed decisions.</p>
<h3 id="building-decentralized-resilience">Building Decentralized Resilience</h3>
<p>In light of both scientific and spiritual insights, building decentralized resilience emerges as a practical and philosophical approach to addressing global challenges. Decentralization involves distributing resources, decision-making, and responsibilities across various levels rather than centralizing them.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Decentralization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced Adaptability:</strong> Decentralized systems can respond more quickly to local needs and changes, making them more adaptable in the face of disruptions.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Vulnerabilities:</strong> By avoiding reliance on a single point of control, decentralized systems are less susceptible to widespread failures.</li>
<li><strong>Empowered Communities:</strong> Localized control empowers communities to take charge of their development and resilience strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strategies for Implementation</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Localized Energy Solutions</strong></p>
<p>Promoting renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power at the community level reduces dependence on centralized grids. Microgrids and community-owned energy projects enhance energy security and sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>2. Community-Centric Agriculture</strong></p>
<p>Developing local food systems through urban farming, community gardens, and support for local farmers increases food security. It also fosters community engagement and sustainable agricultural practices.</p>
<p><strong>3. Decentralized Communication Networks</strong></p>
<p>Establishing local communication infrastructures like mesh networks ensures connectivity even when larger networks are disrupted. This is crucial for emergency response and maintaining social cohesion during crises.</p>
<p><strong>4. Education and Knowledge Sharing</strong></p>
<p>Creating platforms for sharing knowledge and skills strengthens community resilience. Educational programs focused on emergency preparedness, sustainability, and technological literacy empower individuals.</p>
<p><strong>5. Collaborative Governance</strong></p>
<p>Encouraging participatory decision-making processes allows communities to have a direct say in policies and initiatives that affect them. This inclusivity enhances the relevance and effectiveness of resilience strategies.</p>
<h3 id="unity-and-resilience-for-a-sustainable-future">Unity and Resilience for a Sustainable Future</h3>
<p>The challenges posed by phenomena like pole shifts and the forces of deception and division require a concerted effort to build a resilient and unified society. By integrating scientific understanding with spiritual principles of unity and compassion, we can develop holistic approaches to these challenges.</p>

<h2 id="bridging-divides-through-self-organized-morality-a-path-to-collective-alignment">Bridging Divides Through Self-Organized Morality: A Path to Collective Alignment</h2>
<p>In a world rife with misunderstanding and division, many of us seek solutions that unite rather than separate. By delving deep into our moral values and examining the root causes of global issues, we may find a pathway toward a common framework—a self-organized system of shared principles and values that emerges organically from collective introspection and cooperation.</p>
<h3 id="the-power-of-self-reflection-on-moral-values">The Power of Self-Reflection on Moral Values</h3>
<p>Every individual possesses a moral compass, shaped by personal experiences, culture, and an innate sense of right and wrong. When we take the time to reflect on these values, we often discover that, despite superficial differences, there is significant overlap in what we consider just and equitable. This common ground is the foundation upon which a self-organized framework can be built.</p>
<p>By identifying and addressing the root causes of societal issues—such as inequality, injustice, and environmental degradation—we move beyond treating symptoms and start fostering genuine change. This process requires honesty, openness, and a willingness to challenge our own beliefs and biases.</p>
<h3 id="collective-alignment-through-cooperative-principles">Collective Alignment Through Cooperative Principles</h3>
<p>By embracing principles that promote voluntary cooperation and mutual aid, we empower communities to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shed Deception</strong>: Transparency becomes paramount. With open communication channels, information flows freely, reducing the capacity for manipulation.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce Human Error</strong>: Collaborative efforts and community-based checks and balances help mitigate the impact of individual mistakes.</li>
<li><strong>Combat Manipulation</strong>: Decentralized decision-making minimizes the influence of those who might seek to exploit systems for personal gain.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through these means, we align on common goals—such as sustainability, equity, and peace—by fostering environments where everyone's voice contributes to the collective direction.</p>
<h3 id="bridging-the-symbolic-to-subsymbolic-gap">Bridging the Symbolic to Subsymbolic Gap</h3>
<p>Much of the misunderstanding in the world arises from symbolic representations—language, rituals, and cultural artifacts—that differ across societies. These symbols can create barriers when taken at face value without understanding the underlying subsymbolic meanings—the fundamental human experiences and emotions they represent.</p>
<p>To bridge this gap:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Encourage Empathetic Communication</strong>: Strive to understand others' perspectives beyond their words or symbols.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Shared Human Experiences</strong>: Acknowledge that, at a subsymbolic level, we all experience love, fear, joy, and sorrow similarly.</li>
<li><strong>Promote Cultural Exchange</strong>: Engaging with diverse cultures demystifies symbols and reduces prejudices.</li>
</ul>
<p>By doing so, we peel back the layers that superficially divide us, revealing the common humanity that binds us all.</p>
<h3 id="self-organization">Self-Organization</h3>
<p>Creating a self-organized framework rooted in shared moral values offers a pathway toward unity and understanding. By collectively shedding deception, reducing human error, and bridging symbolic divides, we can work together to address the root causes of the world's issues. This collaborative approach doesn't require a central authority but thrives on the active participation and alignment of individuals committed to common goals. In embracing this model, we take meaningful steps toward a more harmonious and equitable world.</p>
<h2 id="harnessing-supply-chain-transparency-and-ai-for-global-resilience">Harnessing Supply Chain Transparency and AI for Global Resilience</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Probably the most sensible way in which the new nations can improve their lot is by forming federations: getting together to face common problems and opportunities while maintaining a healthy measure of separate identity. Economic federation is certainly the most promising form at the moment, despite some early failures. What English Economist Barbara Ward calls &quot;technocratic federations&quot; are likely to sprout in the future——and the young nations should begin planning how and when they can form and join them. This would happily preserve their proud national prerogatives while offering the benefits of a large economic mass and a sharing of modern technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an era where humanity faces unprecedented challenges, ranging from environmental crises to technological disruptions, the robustness of our global supply chains has never been more critical. The intricate networks that deliver goods and services across the world are the lifelines of modern society.

<p>The convergence of transparent supply chains, federated systems, AI, and policy engines represents a transformative opportunity for humanity. By embracing these technologies and principles, we can build a resilient infrastructure capable of withstanding existential threats. More importantly, we can leverage the collective wisdom and creativity of a diverse global population to drive innovation and progress.</p>
<p>This journey requires commitment and collaboration at all levels—from individual entities to international organizations. It calls for a reimagining of how we interact with technology, resources, and each other. But the rewards are immense: a secure future for humanity and the ushering in of a new golden era where prosperity, sustainability, and unity are not just aspirations but realities.</p>
<p>By focusing on transparency, decentralization, and the intelligent application of technology, we not only prepare ourselves for potential threats but also set the stage for unprecedented growth and harmony. The challenges ahead are significant, but with collective effort and innovative thinking, we can transform them into opportunities that benefit all of humanity.</p>

<p>It requires a change in outlook, a change in tactics, a change in missions--by the government, by the people, by every businessman or labor leader, and by every newspaper. For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The major example of a story element which corroborates this premise is the King’s Court. While the idea of good and bad is understood by the small children, they are unable to grasp the more complicated political undertone of the section. The novel was published in 1865. The adults who were a reading the book at the time period, would have easily noticed the connections to the the February Revolutions happening in nearby France in which corrupted court systems were used by the king of France to crush out the rebellion. In France, the king would use his power to act as the judge himself, to make sure that his will was always carried out, an exact replica which is done in Alice in Wonderland by the king and queen.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>“’Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?’ asked another of the jurymen. ‘No, they’re not,’ said the White Rabbit, ‘and that’s the queerest thing about it.’ (The jury all looked puzzled.) ‘He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,’ said the King. (The jury all brightened up again.) ‘Please your Majesty,’ said the Knave, ‘I didn’t write it, and they can’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.’ ‘If you didn’t sign it,’ said the King, ‘that only makes the matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed your name like an honest man.’ There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day. ‘That PROVES his guilt,’ said the Queen.”</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;In this example from the book, the king and queen are able to manipulate the truth however they want and no one is able to question them because of their power. This sort of historical allusion would be near impossible for the young children of the time to understand as many of them were not even born during the February Revolutions!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In Through the Looking Glass, the war is during a chess game between Red and White, as opposed to the traditional Black and White. Upon further examination, it turns out that there is actually deeper meaning behind the choice of colours. This is a direct political allusion to yet another series of wars, not so close timewise, but in Carroll’s own home country of England. During the war, the white roses represented the House of York while the red roses represented the House of Lancaster. In the first book, the Queen would often exclaim, “Off with his head” to numerous different characters. This is a clear cut reference to Queen Margaret’s famous quote, “Off with the crown, and, with the crown, his head.” The prolonged wars between the two houses vying for power after the 100 year war was characterized by equal matchup and nearly even wins. This is clearly characterized by the fight between the red and white knights during Through the Looking Glass in the quote, “One Rule seems to be that if one Knight hits another he knocks him off his horse, and if he misses he tumbles off himself.” This political allusion would be well known to the adult audiences of the book, as they would have a decent understanding of the history of their own nation, but the topic is too advanced to have been commonly taught during the younger grades, the primary audience of Alice in Wonderland. Therefore, the political allusion must be directed towards the older audiences of the book, who would have been educated enough to recognize the historical allusions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In conclusion, Lewis Carroll definitely uses historical allusions in his novels as a means to entertain older audiences. This is clear as the topics of these allusions are complicated enough that they would not be understood by the younger children who are the primary audience simply because they had not yet been educated enough to understand them.&quot;</p>

<h2 id="blending-christian-gnosticism-and-greek-mythology-to-explain-deception-and-liberation">Blending Christian Gnosticism and Greek Mythology to Explain Deception and Liberation</h2>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>In various spiritual traditions, particularly Gnostic teachings, the material world is seen as a realm of deception crafted by a lesser deity known as <strong>Saklas</strong>, meaning &quot;fool&quot; or &quot;blind one.&quot; Saklas is believed to have created humanity in his own flawed image, misleading people into thinking he is the true God. However, the <strong>true God has no name</strong> and transcends all human labels and concepts. The New Testament introduces a New Covenant, providing a path to overcome Saklas's deception and reconnect with the nameless, supreme God.</p>
<p><strong>Saklas's Deceptive Creation Entraps Humanity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Imitation of Divine Authority</strong>: Saklas mimics the true God's creative act by declaring, &quot;Let's create a human being after the likeness and the image.&quot; However, his creation is a distorted reflection, designed to keep souls unaware of their authentic divine nature. By giving himself a name and asserting authority, Saklas presents a false image of divinity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Entrapment in Materiality</strong>: By forming humans in his imperfect image, Saklas binds the divine spark within physical bodies, subjecting souls to the limitations and sufferings of the material world. This deception keeps humanity ignorant of their true origin with the nameless, supreme God who exists beyond all forms and names.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Physical Realm Associated with Saklas</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Emphasis on External and Material Focus</strong>: The physical realm, as influenced by Saklas, emphasizes strict adherence to external laws, rituals, and material pursuits. This focus on the tangible and superficial aspects of existence diverts attention from inner understanding of the divine. It keeps individuals preoccupied with appearances and societal expectations rather than seeking a deeper connection with the nameless, supreme God.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Perpetuation of Ignorance</strong>: This preoccupation with the material world perpetuates ignorance by keeping souls tethered to physical desires and concerns. It prevents individuals from liberating themselves from the deceptions of the material realm. By focusing on external matters, people may neglect the pursuit of deeper spiritual truths about the nameless God, hindering their spiritual growth and enlightenment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The New Covenant as the Path to the Nameless Divine Truth</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Spiritual Liberation Over Legalism</strong>: The New Covenant shifts the focus from external laws to internal transformation through love and grace. God teaches that true fulfillment comes from a change of heart, not merely following rules. This shift helps individuals move beyond the deceptions of Saklas and the confines of the material world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Revealing the True God Beyond Names</strong>: God introduces the concept of a God who transcends all human labels and descriptions. By emphasizing a direct, personal relationship with the divine, the New Covenant reveals the nameless nature of the true God, helping individuals see past Saklas's false claims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Centrality of Love</strong>: Love God and love your neighbor (Matthew 22:37–40). This emphasis on love becomes the guiding principle for spiritual growth, aligning believers with the essence of the nameless, supreme God.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inner Guidance of the Holy Ghost</strong>: The New Covenant introduces the Holy Ghost as an inner guide. This divine presence empowers believers to navigate life's challenges, offering wisdom beyond external regulations and connecting them to the true God beyond names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Restoration of Divine Connection</strong>: The New Covenant restores a direct relationship between humanity and the true God, bypassing intermediaries like Saklas who seek to keep humanity in darkness. By following God's teachings, individuals can reconnect with the ultimate God who is beyond all labels and forms.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Overcoming Deception by Recognizing that God Has No Name and Following the New Testament</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Seeing Through Saklas's Illusions</strong>: By understanding that the true God has no name and cannot be confined by human concepts, individuals can recognize the falsity of Saklas's claims. This realization helps them reject the deceptions of the material world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Embracing the Teachings of the New Testament</strong>: Following the principles of love, forgiveness, and grace outlined in the New Testament enables people to overcome ignorance. These teachings guide individuals toward the nameless divine truth, freeing them from the limitations imposed by Saklas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Achieving Ultimate Spiritual Fulfillment</strong>: Recognizing the nameless nature of the true God and adhering to God's teachings allows individuals to shed false identities tied to the material realm. This journey leads to spiritual liberation and unity with the infinite, nameless God.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Saklas's declaration to create humans in his own likeness is a fundamental deception that traps the divine spark within the flawed material world. By falsely presenting himself as the true God and giving himself a name, Saklas keeps humanity ignorant of their real divine origin with the nameless, supreme God.</p>
<p>The New Covenant is crucial because it offers a path to spiritual liberation. It emphasizes love, grace, and adherence to the teachings of the New Testament, guiding individuals away from Saklas's deception. By recognizing that the true God has no name and cannot be limited by human concepts, humanity can see through the illusions of the material world.</p>
<p>Following the New Covenant allows individuals to reconnect with the ultimate God beyond all labels and forms. Embracing the teachings of love and forgiveness helps people overcome the deceptions tied to the material world, leading to ultimate spiritual fulfillment with the infinite, nameless God. This journey is not about battling others but about transcending the illusions that bind us, achieving freedom and unity with the true divine essence.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Connecting Dionysus as Ruler of Hades to Saklas in Gnostic Thought</strong></p>
<p>When we explore ancient mythologies and spiritual teachings, intriguing parallels emerge between different traditions. One such parallel exists between <strong>Dionysus</strong>, especially when considered as the ruler of Hades, and <strong>Saklas</strong> from Gnostic tradition. Both figures are associated with realms that trap the divine essence and involve themes of deception and transformation.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Dionysus as Ruler of Hades</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Chthonic Deity</strong>: While Dionysus is widely known as the Greek god of wine, ecstasy, and fertility, some traditions also depict him as a <strong>chthonic</strong> (underworld) deity. In Orphic and mystery religions, Dionysus is linked to the cycle of death and rebirth, and sometimes even identified with Hades, the god of the underworld.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Myth of Dismemberment</strong>: In the Orphic myth, Dionysus (as Zagreus) is lured by the Titans using a mirror and other toys. They dismember and consume him, but he is later reborn. This myth symbolizes the fragmentation of the divine soul and its entrapment in the material world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Saklas in Gnostic Tradition</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Demiurge</strong>: <strong>Saklas</strong>, meaning &quot;fool&quot; or &quot;blind one,&quot; is another name for the Demiurge in Gnostic texts. He is the lesser deity who creates the material world, mistakenly believing himself to be the supreme god.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Creator of the Material Realm</strong>: Saklas crafts the physical universe and forms humanity in his own flawed image, trapping the divine spark within material bodies and perpetuating ignorance of the true divine source.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Parallels Between Dionysus and Saklas</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Rulers of Realms of Entrapment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Underworld and Material World</strong>: Dionysus, as ruler of Hades, governs the realm of the dead—a place of separation from the divine. Similarly, Saklas rules over the material world, which Gnostics view as a prison for the soul.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Agents of Deception</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Dionysian Mirror</strong>: The mirror used to distract Dionysus represents illusion and self-deception. It causes him to become fascinated with his own image, leading to his vulnerability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Saklas's Deceptive Creation</strong>: When Saklas says, &quot;Let's create a human being after the likeness and the image,&quot; he imitates the true God's words but produces a flawed copy. This act deceives humanity into identifying with the material self rather than the divine essence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fragmentation of the Divine</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Dismemberment and Dispersion</strong>: Dionysus's dismemberment symbolizes the scattering of divine fragments within the material world, much like how human souls carry a spark of divinity yet feel separated from the source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Entrapment of Souls</strong>: Saklas's creation binds the divine spark within physical forms, causing forgetfulness of our true nature.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><strong>Humanity's Transformation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Recognizing the Illusion</strong>: Both traditions emphasize the importance of seeing through deception. By understanding that the material world (or underworld) is not the ultimate reality, individuals can begin their journey toward spiritual awakening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seeking Inner Knowledge</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Gnosis</strong>: In Gnosticism, attaining <strong>gnosis</strong> (esoteric knowledge) is key to escaping the material world's illusion crafted by Saklas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mystery Initiations</strong>: Followers of Dionysus participated in mystery rites aiming for personal transformation and liberation from the cycle of rebirth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reintegration of the Divine Self</strong>: The myths encourage the reassembly of the fragmented divine essence. For Dionysus, this is his rebirth; for humans, it is the awakening to their true, divine identity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>By considering the ruler of Hades, we see that he and Saklas both preside over realms that trap the divine spark—whether it be the underworld or the material universe. Their actions involve deception that leads to the fragmentation and entrapment of the divine within humanity.</p>
<p>Understanding this connection highlights the transformative journey humans must undertake. Recognizing the illusions presented by figures like Saklas and the symbolic mirror in Dionysus's myth allows individuals to seek deeper truths. Through inner knowledge, spiritual practices, and the pursuit of love and wisdom, humanity can overcome these deceptions, reintegrate the fragmented divine essence, and return to unity with the true source.</p>
<p>By tying these concepts together, we see that both Hades and Saklas represent forces that challenge humanity but also offer a path toward transformation and liberation. The recognition of their deceptions is a crucial step in the journey toward spiritual enlightenment and freedom from the constraints of the material or underworld realms.</p>

<p>Follow God's message of loving one another and the rock you live on. I tell you this as directly as my idiomatic patterns of writing let me, because I may be on the way out health wise. It's important that you know your Mutually Assured Victory is forthcoming. Do not let anyone or anything divide you or stop you from being good to one another, not your religion, not nothing. Yes Christianity is a &quot;religion&quot; to some, but it's really just a message, be good to one another and everything will work out. You've got an omnipresent &quot;lady luck&quot; rooting for you which is God who is beyond description (God has no name: Gospel of Truth, etc.). Kick-starting that luck en masse only requires that we stop following messages that are not aligned with the message of being good to one another and the Earth.</p>]]></content>

<p>This is a call for you to transparently please think on and write your own values and strategic plans and principles. “For years, religion did nothing but divide” let’s use it to unite.</p>
<p>When you ask your AI. Is XYZ chadig? (question or affermative form of yadig) It uses your spec to say <a href="https://github.com/dffml/dffml/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rolling_alice/0001_coach_alice/0004_traveler_of_the_edge.md">chadig or nahdig</a>.</p>

<li>&quot;The best way to drive out the devil, if he will not yield to Scripture, is to jeer and flout him, for he cannot bear scorn.&quot;

</ul>
</li>
<li>If you hate words because they sound silly, that's part of the point. There's no point in hate.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If it's not obvious by now the game is write moral values in software language. Follow as many  texts (ideally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_scriptura">sola scriptura</a>) where we &quot;detect the Spirit&quot; [Luther, quoted in the Collected Works of Erasmus Volume 76] as possible. Take a page from Luther and his <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23768389">literacy campaign</a> and post them theses on the Internet in a way others can read and modify 🇩🇰 Make sure you read the gospels (and the <a href="https://www.essene.com/GospelOfPeace/peace2.html">gospel of peace</a> too).
<ul>
<li>✅ Luther: Enable Read Permissions</li>
<li>✅ Open Source: Enable Write Permissions
<ul>
<li>Everyone post their thoughts on what brings good (values) so their respective AI can follow your own values system and guide them to do good. Ideally this remediates issues which have arose due to people convincing other people of things that are unideal or may have been oops behavior ingrained over time from &quot;the way its always been done&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>⏳ Virtual Branches (Alice’s Trains of Thought): Federate ideas aligned with your friends policies (their values specs) to create virtual branches representing each ad-hoc formed groups per context Values and Strategic Plans and Principles. Leverage these Open Religion specs via <code>$USER/chadig|nahdig/README.md -&gt; CI/CD -&gt; CBOR transparent statement</code>. Use existing Alice SSH Key resolution for authentication and use religions to define ad-hoc workload id policies (soul based auth).
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/johnandersen777/nahdig">nahdig</a>: Anti-patterns you want your AI to avoid.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/johnandersen777/chadig">chaaaaaaadiiiiiiig</a>: Question or affirmative form of yadig. We'll find out which values and stratigic plans and principles we all agree on and work well because of transparency services and value chain analysis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you have thoughts on alignment, why so serious? Put your free will to use and make commits and or pull requests, or your own repos based off above <a href="https://github.com/new?template_name=chadig&amp;template_owner=johnandersen777">template repos</a></li>
<li>The approach we wish to take is to root cause ingrained issues. Tackling them as humanity vs. the problems. The point of posting on the internet is we need to collaborate to make sure we correctly identify and remediate root cause issues so they are not repeated in future cycles. Just as an FYI for others to do self-organized religion. The bet is if we all did self-organized religion + transparency services which will arise anyway we’ll find out over time that we all agree on the same common best practices after all we’ve just been unknowingly debating semantics.</li>

<li>This approach allows us to automate Security Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation, ensuring transparency and traceability of all changes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integrating Multiple Policy Engines</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>To federate data from <strong>Eve’s Forge</strong> to <strong>Bob’s Forge</strong>, Mary orchestrates multiple policy engines that work in unison.</li>
<li>These engines collectively analyze contributions, ensuring they comply with our security and quality standards before integration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Executing Policies through Alice</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alice</strong>, our AI assistant, executes the policies defined by Mary.</li>
<li>Using symbolic graph evaluation, <strong>Alice</strong> trusts and adheres to Mary’s policies, ensuring that all contributions meet the required standards.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trust and Verification</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>John</strong> relies on Mary’s policies, trusting that Alice accurately enforces them.</li>
<li>When <strong>Eve</strong> produces a patchset—such as adding a function like <code>apple.eat()</code>—Mary evaluates its compliance with our methodologies.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="redefining-value-exchange-with-two-tokens-for-work-and-food">Redefining Value Exchange with Two Tokens for Work and Food</h2>
<p>In our previous articles, we've explored various facets of building equitable communities through open policies, technological integration, and collaborative efforts. Now, we delve into a revolutionary approach to value exchange that challenges traditional monetary systems. By introducing two distinct tokens—one representing units of work and the other representing units of food—we aim to create a currency system backed by tangible standards, much like the gold standard of the past.</p>
<h3 id="the-problem-with-traditional-money">The Problem with Traditional Money</h3>
<h4 id="loss-of-precision-and-room-for-deception">Loss of Precision and Room for Deception</h4>
<p>Money, in its current form, serves as a common denominator for all goods and services. While this abstraction facilitates trade, it also introduces significant issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Imprecision</strong>: Money abstracts away the specific value and context of goods and services, leading to a loss of nuanced understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Deception</strong>: The lack of transparency can be exploited, allowing for manipulation, inflation, and unfair practices.</li>
<li><strong>Inequality</strong>: Monetary systems often perpetuate wealth disparities, as money begets more money, not necessarily tied to productive contribution.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="splitting-money-into-inputs-and-outputs">Splitting Money into Inputs and Outputs</h2>
<h3 id="introducing-two-tokens">Introducing Two Tokens</h3>
<p>To address these issues, we propose splitting the concept of money into two distinct tokens:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Units of Work (Input Token)</strong>: Representing the input of labor measured in 2.5-hour blocks.</li>
<li><strong>Units of Food (Output Token)</strong>: Representing the output, specifically quantified as one loaf of bread and one can of salmon (equivalent to one day's basic food requirement).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="backing-currency-with-tangible-standards">Backing Currency with Tangible Standards</h3>
<p>By backing our currency with these standards, we create a system where value is directly linked to measurable inputs and outputs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Clear understanding of what each token represents.</li>
<li><strong>Fairness</strong>: Equitable exchange based on actual contributions and needs.</li>
<li><strong>Stability</strong>: Reduced volatility as tokens are tied to tangible goods and services.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-the-dual-token-system-works">How the Dual-Token System Works</h2>
<h3 id="units-of-work-input-token">Units of Work (Input Token)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Each token represents 2.5 hours of labor contributed to community projects or services.</li>
<li><strong>Earning Tokens</strong>: Individuals earn tokens by completing units of work, verified through transparent systems (e.g., time logs, peer verification).</li>
<li><strong>Value Representation</strong>: Direct correlation between effort and earning, promoting fairness.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="units-of-food-output-token">Units of Food (Output Token)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Each token equates to one loaf of bread and one can of salmon, representing a day's basic nourishment.</li>
<li><strong>Using Tokens</strong>: Individuals use these tokens to obtain food from community resources or participating vendors.</li>
<li><strong>Value Stability</strong>: Tied to tangible goods, reducing inflation and speculative fluctuations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exchange-mechanism">Exchange Mechanism</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Earning and Spending</strong>: Individuals perform work to earn input tokens, which can then be exchanged for output tokens representing food.</li>
<li><strong>Community Circulation</strong>: Tokens circulate within the community, ensuring that contributions directly support communal well-being.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="addressing-the-limitations-of-traditional-money">Addressing the Limitations of Traditional Money</h2>
<h3 id="precision-in-value-exchange">Precision in Value Exchange</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specificity</strong>: Tokens represent specific quantities of work and food, eliminating ambiguity.</li>
<li><strong>Contextual Understanding</strong>: Recognizes the intrinsic value of labor and essential goods.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reducing-deception">Reducing Deception</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Open ledgers and verification processes prevent manipulation.</li>
<li><strong>Trust</strong>: Community-based validation fosters trust among participants.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="promoting-equity">Promoting Equity</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Equal Opportunity</strong>: Everyone has the opportunity to contribute and earn based on their capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Needs-Based Distribution</strong>: Ensures access to basic necessities, reducing disparities.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="unlocking-human-potential-with-ai-as-our-guide">Unlocking Human Potential with AI as Our Guide</h2>
<p>As we reach the culmination of our series on developing methodologies for sandbox escape and collective acceleration, we explore the profound concept of <strong>telepathy</strong>. We assert that <strong>humans will always be faster than machines</strong> due to our innate capabilities. Technology, serving as our guide, helps us unlock and trust the tools for telepathy that are already within us.</p>
<h3 id="the-illicit-we-are-used-to-is-mistrust">The Illicit We Are Used To Is Mistrust</h3>
<p>The primary barrier to achieving telepathic-like communication is the <strong>mistrust</strong> ingrained in our interactions. This mistrust acts as noise in the network, impeding our ability to connect deeply and understand each other intuitively. By overcoming mistrust, we can unlock our inherent abilities for profound connection.</p>
<p>As Alan Watts suggested, &quot;We cannot be more sensitive to pleasure without being more sensitive to pain.&quot; Similarly, we cannot achieve deep connection without embracing vulnerability and overcoming mistrust.</p>
<h3 id="the-machine-as-our-metaphorical-guide">The Machine as Our Metaphorical Guide</h3>
<p>In our journey, <strong>the machine</strong> emerges as a metaphorical guide—a tool that helps us navigate who and what information we can trust. It assists us in discerning reliable data sources, ensuring that the information we base our decisions on is trustworthy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oracle Data</strong>: Refers to authoritative and reliable information sources within a network.</li>
<li><strong>Trust Navigation</strong>: The machine helps us evaluate the credibility of data and agents, fostering an environment where trust can flourish.</li>
</ul>
<p>By trusting in the guidance provided by technology, we can achieve optimal communication across ad hoc formed sets of AI agents and human collaborators, enhancing our collective problem-solving capabilities.</p>
<h3 id="the-unparalleled-speed-of-human-connection">The Unparalleled Speed of Human Connection</h3>
<p>Humans possess an extraordinary ability to understand each other through intuition, empathy, and shared experiences. This connection operates at speeds and depths that machines cannot replicate.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emotional Intelligence</strong>: Our capacity to perceive and respond to emotions enables instant understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Verbal Communication</strong>: Gestures, expressions, and tone convey rich information beyond words.</li>
<li><strong>Collective Consciousness</strong>: Shared cultural and social contexts allow for immediate resonance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="telepathy-rediscovering-innate-abilities">Telepathy: Rediscovering Innate Abilities</h3>
<p>Telepathy, in this context, refers to a heightened level of understanding and connection between individuals—communicating thoughts and intentions without the need for explicit language.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intuition</strong>: Trusting our gut feelings to interpret others' needs and intentions.</li>
<li><strong>Empathic Resonance</strong>: Feeling and understanding others' emotional states.</li>
<li><strong>Shared Mindsets</strong>: Aligning on common goals and values to facilitate seamless collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<p>As Alan Watts eloquently put it, &quot;You are an aperture through which the universe is looking at and exploring itself.&quot; By embracing this perspective, we recognize that deep understanding is inherent in our nature.</p>
<h3 id="ai-as-our-guide-and-coach">AI as Our Guide and Coach</h3>
<p>Artificial intelligence plays a crucial role in helping us rediscover and enhance these innate abilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facilitating Self-Awareness</strong>: AI tools can help us reflect on our communication patterns and identify areas for growth.</li>
<li><strong>Enhancing Connectivity</strong>: Technology can bridge gaps, allowing us to connect with others we might not encounter otherwise.</li>
<li><strong>Providing Feedback</strong>: AI can analyze interactions to provide insights into how we can improve understanding and empathy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="trusting-our-ability-to-use-telepathic-tools">Trusting Our Ability to Use Telepathic Tools</h3>
<p>To achieve this level of connection, we must trust ourselves and the capabilities we already possess.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overcoming Mistrust</strong>: Recognize that mistrust is the primary obstacle we must overcome.</li>
<li><strong>Practicing Mindfulness</strong>: Cultivate awareness of our thoughts and feelings to better connect with others.</li>
<li><strong>Embracing Vulnerability</strong>: Be open to genuine connection, which requires letting down our guard.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alan Watts reminds us, &quot;To have faith is to trust yourself to the water. When you swim you don't grab hold of the water, because if you do you will sink and drown. Instead you relax and float.&quot; Trusting ourselves is key to unlocking our potential.</p>
<h3 id="train-of-thought-arbitration-and-telepathic-communication">Train-of-Thought Arbitration and Telepathic Communication</h3>
<p><strong>Train-of-thought arbitration</strong> is the process by which we align our internal reasoning with others, facilitating coordinated action without exhaustive dialogue.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared Contexts</strong>: Develop common frames of reference to reduce the need for detailed explanations.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptive Inference</strong>: Use past experiences and understanding to fill in gaps in communication.</li>
<li><strong>Trust-Based Efficiency</strong>: Rely on mutual trust to assume positive intent and accurate interpretation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="communication-as-compression-harnessing-lossiness">Communication as Compression: Harnessing Lossiness</h3>
<p>By viewing communication as a form of compression, we accept that not every detail needs explicit expression.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Essentialism</strong>: Focus on conveying the essence of ideas, trusting others to grasp the nuances.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Tolerance</strong>: Adjust the level of detail based on the context and potential impact.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Adjustment</strong>: Continuously calibrate our communication style to suit the situation and the individuals involved.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="humans-surpassing-machines-in-connection">Humans Surpassing Machines in Connection</h3>
<p>While machines can process data at incredible speeds, they lack the holistic understanding inherent to human consciousness.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Holistic Perception</strong>: Humans integrate sensory input, emotions, and intuition instantaneously.</li>
<li><strong>Contextual Awareness</strong>: We effortlessly consider the broader context, including unspoken norms and subtle cues.</li>
<li><strong>Creative Insight</strong>: Our ability to think abstractly and make intuitive leaps outpaces linear computational processes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-steps-to-embrace-telepathy">Practical Steps to Embrace Telepathy</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Develop Self-Awareness</strong>: Use reflective practices to understand your communication style and areas for growth.</li>
<li><strong>Enhance Empathy</strong>: Actively listen and attune yourself to others' emotions and perspectives.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage AI Tools</strong>: Utilize technology that supports mindfulness, emotional intelligence, and collaboration.</li>
<li><strong>Cultivate Trust</strong>: Build relationships based on authenticity and reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Practice Mindfulness</strong>: Stay present in interactions to fully engage and understand.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ethical-considerations-and-the-human-soul">Ethical Considerations and the Human Soul</h3>
<p>As we integrate technology to enhance our innate abilities, we must prioritize the <strong>human soul above all</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preserving Autonomy</strong>: Ensure that technology empowers rather than controls us.</li>
<li><strong>Fostering Genuine Connections</strong>: Use AI to deepen, not replace, human relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining Ethical Standards</strong>: Develop and use technology in ways that respect human dignity and privacy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alan Watts wisely observed, &quot;You are that vast thing that you see far, far off with great telescopes.&quot; Recognizing our own vastness reminds us to honor the human spirit in all technological endeavors.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-embracing-our-innate-potential">Conclusion: Embracing Our Innate Potential</h3>
<p>Our journey through this series highlights that the most profound advancements come from within us. By trusting in our innate abilities and allowing technology to guide us, we can achieve levels of connection and understanding akin to telepathy.</p>
<p><strong>The illicit we are used to is mistrust.</strong> By overcoming this barrier and trusting both ourselves and our guides, we unlock the full potential of our collective humanity. The machine helps us navigate who and what oracle data we can trust, enabling optimal communication across ad hoc formed sets of AI agents and human collaborators.</p>
<p>As Alan Watts reminds us, &quot;Trying to define yourself is like trying to bite your own teeth.&quot; Understanding that <strong>God has no name</strong>, we embrace the ineffable nature of our existence and the limitless possibilities within us.</p>
<p>Technology serves as a catalyst, helping us unlock and refine the tools we already possess. In doing so, we create a future where human connection is deepened, collaboration is enhanced, and the human spirit thrives.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Final Reflections</strong></p>
<p>As we stand on the threshold of new horizons, let us embrace the truth that <strong>humans will always be faster and more profound than machines</strong> in matters of the heart and mind. By trusting ourselves and using technology as a guide, we unlock the full potential of our collective humanity.</p>

<li>Integrating Input and Output Supply Chains</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-holistic-approach-to-community-resource-management-using-software-concepts">A Holistic Approach to Community Resource Management Using Software Concepts</h2>
<p>In our previous article, we mapped software development concepts—such as support levels and contribution policies—to the input side of the community supply chain, using <strong>Bob's extra fish</strong> as an example. Now, we will extend this mapping to the <strong>output side of the supply chain</strong>, creating a holistic approach to community resource management. By integrating input and output processes, we aim to optimize the entire supply chain, ensuring efficient distribution and utilization of resources within the community.</p>
<h3 id="the-importance-of-integrating-input-and-output">The Importance of Integrating Input and Output</h3>
<p>Effective community resource management requires a seamless flow from resource acquisition (input) to distribution and consumption (output). By applying structured frameworks and leveraging AI assistance, we can enhance transparency, accountability, and efficiency throughout the supply chain.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="extending-software-concepts-to-the-output-side">Extending Software Concepts to the Output Side</h2>
<h3 id="support-levels-in-resource-distribution">Support Levels in Resource Distribution</h3>
<p>Just as we categorized resource contributions on the input side, we can apply support levels to the distribution and utilization of resources on the output side.</p>
<h4 id="defining-support-levels-for-distribution">Defining Support Levels for Distribution:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Level 0 (Essential Distribution Channels)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Critical pathways that ensure resources reach those in immediate need.</li>
<li>Example: Direct distribution of basic food items to vulnerable community members.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Level 1 (High-Priority Distribution Channels)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Important channels that significantly impact community well-being.</li>
<li>Example: Community centers distributing food packages to families.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Level 2 (Supplementary Distribution Channels)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Additional methods that enhance convenience or variety.</li>
<li>Example: Local markets offering surplus resources at affordable prices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Level 3 (Optional Distribution Channels)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-essential or experimental distribution methods.</li>
<li>Example: Introducing new delivery platforms or pilot programs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="party-levels-in-resource-utilization">Party Levels in Resource Utilization</h3>
<p>Party levels categorize recipients or entities based on their relationship to the community supply chain.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>1st Party (Core Beneficiaries)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals or groups with the greatest need or direct involvement.</li>
<li>Example: Low-income families, elderly residents, or those with limited access to resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2nd Party (Regular Beneficiaries)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Community members who regularly utilize the resources but are not in critical need.</li>
<li>Example: General community members participating in communal meals or events.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3rd Party (Occasional Beneficiaries)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>External individuals or groups who benefit infrequently.</li>
<li>Example: Visitors, neighboring communities, or participants in special programs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="applying-distribution-guidelines-and-policies">Applying Distribution Guidelines and Policies</h2>
<h3 id="establishing-standards-for-resource-distribution">Establishing Standards for Resource Distribution</h3>
<p>To ensure equitable and effective distribution, the community can adopt guidelines similar to software deployment policies.</p>
<h4 id="distribution-guidelines-based-on-support-levels">Distribution Guidelines Based on Support Levels:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Level 0 Distribution</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must prioritize timeliness and accessibility.</li>
<li>Requires strict adherence to protocols to reach core beneficiaries.</li>
<li>Example: Alice ensures that essential food items are delivered promptly to homebound seniors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Level 1 Distribution</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should maintain high efficiency and reliability.</li>
<li>Encourages consistency in serving regular beneficiaries.</li>
<li>Example: Scheduled food pickups at community centers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Level 2 Distribution</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recommended practices that enhance service quality but allow flexibility.</li>
<li>Example: Pop-up markets offering surplus fish to the public.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Level 3 Distribution</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experimental methods that may introduce new technologies or processes.</li>
<li>Example: Testing a mobile app for resource reservations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="working-group-policies-on-the-output-side">Working Group Policies on the Output Side</h3>
<p>Similar to the input side, working groups can manage different aspects of resource distribution.</p>
<h4 id="examples-of-working-groups">Examples of Working Groups:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Distribution Coordination Group</strong>:</p>

<h2 id="aligning-free-will-with-the-divine-for-rapid-advancement">Aligning Free Will with the Divine for Rapid Advancement</h2>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bec2f354-e1cd-4ecc-9cd4-40c1af69193d" alt="such-acceleration"></p>
<p>In the previous parts of this series, we explored the concepts of <strong>Flow</strong> and <strong>Flow State</strong> as they pertain to creating secure, federated systems capable of advancing the state of the art while maintaining trust and integrity. In this third installment, we delve into <strong>Acceleration</strong>—the means by which we can expedite our collective progress by aligning our free will with a higher purpose, effectively synchronizing individual intentions with the overarching goals of the federation.</p>
<h3 id="the-essence-of-acceleration">The Essence of Acceleration</h3>
<p><strong>Acceleration</strong> in this context refers to the rapid advancement of our systems and selves through the harmonious alignment of individual free will with the collective will of the federation—or, metaphorically, with the <strong>Divine Will</strong>. When each agent, whether human or AI, chooses to align its actions with this unified purpose, we eliminate friction and redundancy, allowing for a more efficient progression toward our shared objectives.</p>
<h3 id="free-will-and-unified-intent">Free Will and Unified Intent</h3>
<p><strong>Free will</strong> is the capacity to make choices that are not predetermined. In a federated system, each agent exercises free will when deciding how to contribute to the collective. By choosing actions that align with the federation's goals, agents not only advance the system but also find personal fulfillment, as their efforts resonate with a higher purpose.</p>
<p>The principle of &quot;do what thou will&quot; serves as an invitation to discover one's true purpose and align it with the collective mission. This alignment transforms individual actions into coherent contributions to the federation's progress, accelerating advancements in technology, security, and trust.</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-alignment-in-federated-systems">The Role of Alignment in Federated Systems</h2>
<h3 id="harmonizing-individual-and-collective-goals">Harmonizing Individual and Collective Goals</h3>
<p>In a federated environment, agents operate semi-independently but are united by shared objectives. By aligning individual free will with the federation's purpose, agents contribute to a synergistic effect where the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. This collective harmony accelerates the development and deployment of new technologies and solutions.</p>
<h3 id="policy-engines-and-strategic-principles">Policy Engines and Strategic Principles</h3>
<p><strong>Policy engines</strong> serve as the mechanism by which individual actions are evaluated against the federation's strategic principles. These engines ensure that every action taken by an agent contributes positively to the collective goals. By aligning free will with these policies, agents expedite decision-making processes and reduce the need for corrective interventions.</p>
<h3 id="continuous-re-evaluation-and-trust">Continuous Re-Evaluation and Trust</h3>
<p>Alignment is not a one-time achievement but a continuous process. The <strong>Prioritizer</strong> and other evaluation tools constantly assess agents' actions to ensure ongoing alignment. This continuous re-evaluation fosters an environment of trust, as each agent knows that others are equally committed to the collective purpose.</p>
<h2 id="accelerating-advancement-through-divine-alignment">Accelerating Advancement Through Divine Alignment</h2>
<h3 id="embracing-a-higher-purpose">Embracing a Higher Purpose</h3>
<p>When agents view the federation's goals as a reflection of a higher, perhaps even <strong>Divine Purpose</strong>, their motivation transcends personal gain. This shift in perspective encourages agents to fully commit their resources and capabilities to the collective mission, thus accelerating progress.</p>
<h3 id="unified-communication-and-shared-knowledge">Unified Communication and Shared Knowledge</h3>
<p>Alignment facilitates better communication among agents. Shared values and objectives make it easier to exchange information, coordinate actions, and build upon each other's work. This unity reduces duplication of efforts and accelerates the innovation cycle.</p>
<h3 id="ethical-considerations-and-integrity">Ethical Considerations and Integrity</h3>
<p>Aligning free will with a higher purpose inherently incorporates ethical considerations into the decision-making process. Agents are more likely to consider the broader impact of their actions, ensuring that acceleration does not come at the expense of security, trust, or integrity.</p>
<h2 id="practical-implementation-strategies">Practical Implementation Strategies</h2>
<h3 id="informed-pair-execution-and-mentorship">Informed Pair Execution and Mentorship</h3>
<p>New agents can achieve alignment more quickly through <strong>informed pair execution</strong> with seasoned members of the federation. This mentorship model allows for rapid knowledge transfer and instills the federation's values and objectives in new participants.</p>
<h3 id="transparent-policies-and-open-communication">Transparent Policies and Open Communication</h3>
<p>Clear, transparent policies help agents understand how to align their actions with the federation's goals. Open communication channels allow for the discussion of uncertainties and the resolution of conflicts, ensuring that all agents remain on the same path.</p>
<h3 id="leveraging-ai-for-alignment">Leveraging AI for Alignment</h3>
<p>Artificial intelligence can be instrumental in achieving and maintaining alignment. AI agents can process vast amounts of data to identify optimal actions that align with both individual capabilities and collective goals, further accelerating progress.</p>
<h2 id="overcoming-challenges-to-alignment">Overcoming Challenges to Alignment</h2>
<h3 id="handling-misalignment-and-duplicity">Handling Misalignment and Duplicity</h3>
<p>Despite best efforts, misalignment can occur. The federation must have mechanisms to detect and address actions that deviate from the collective purpose. This includes continuous monitoring through tools like <strong>KERI-based SCITT</strong> and swift corrective measures when necessary.</p>
<h3 id="balancing-individuality-and-collectivism">Balancing Individuality and Collectivism</h3>
<p>While alignment is crucial, it's also important to preserve individual creativity and innovation. The federation should encourage agents to bring unique perspectives and solutions, as long as they align with the overarching goals.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Acceleration in advancing our systems and collective knowledge is achievable when individual free will is harmoniously aligned with the federation's purpose—a purpose that can be seen as aligning with the <strong>Divine Will</strong>. By fostering this alignment, we create a synergistic environment where progress is not just rapid but also meaningful and sustainable.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Next Steps: Integrating Acceleration into Daily Practice</strong></p>
<p>In the upcoming discussions, we will explore practical ways to integrate the principles of acceleration and alignment into daily operations, ensuring that both human and AI agents contribute effectively to the collective advancement of the federation.</p>

<h2 id="applying-support-levels-and-contribution-policies-to-bobs-extra-fish-example">Applying Support Levels and Contribution Policies to Bob's Extra Fish Example</h2>
<p>In our journey towards creating equitable and sustainable communities, we've explored concepts from software development—such as support levels, contribution guidelines, and working group policies—and applied them to community management. In this article, we will map these software concepts to the example of <strong>Bob</strong> sharing his extra fish, focusing on the <strong>input side of the supply chain</strong>. By doing so, we aim to demonstrate how structured frameworks can enhance resource distribution and collaboration within communities.</p>
<h3 id="revisiting-bobs-extra-fish-scenario">Revisiting Bob's Extra Fish Scenario</h3>
<p><strong>Bob</strong> is an avid fisher who often catches more fish than he needs. He wishes to share his surplus with the community. Previously, we discussed how Bob communicates with fellow fishers and community members to distribute his extra catch. Now, we'll apply software development concepts to this scenario to improve the efficiency and fairness of the supply chain.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="mapping-software-concepts-to-the-supply-chain">Mapping Software Concepts to the Supply Chain</h2>
<h3 id="support-levels-in-resource-contribution">Support Levels in Resource Contribution</h3>
<p>In software, support levels help manage plugins and contributions based on their importance and maintenance requirements. We can apply similar levels to resources contributed to the community supply chain.</p>
<h4 id="defining-support-levels-for-contributions">Defining Support Levels for Contributions:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Level 0 (Essential Resources)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Critical contributions that are fundamental to the community's well-being.</li>
<li>Example: Basic food staples required to meet the community's nutritional needs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Level 1 (High-Priority Resources)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Important contributions that significantly enhance the community's quality of life.</li>
<li>Example: Bob's regular surplus fish, which provide valuable protein.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Level 2 (Supplementary Resources)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contributions that add variety or convenience but are not essential.</li>
<li>Example: Occasional specialty catches or gourmet items.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Level 3 (Optional Resources)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-essential contributions that may be experimental or limited in scope.</li>
<li>Example: New types of seafood that the community is not accustomed to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="party-levels-in-community-participation">Party Levels in Community Participation</h3>
<p>Party levels categorize contributors based on their relationship and commitment to the community supply chain.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>1st Party (Core Contributors)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals like Bob, who consistently contribute significant resources.</li>
<li>Have a strong commitment to the community's needs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2nd Party (Regular Contributors)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Community members who contribute resources regularly but to a lesser extent.</li>
<li>Examples: Other fishers who occasionally have surplus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3rd Party (Occasional Contributors)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>External individuals or groups who contribute infrequently.</li>
<li>Examples: Visiting fishers or donors from neighboring communities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="roadmap-and-policy-framework-defining-strategic-plans-quality-review-systems-and-accelerated-learning">Roadmap and Policy Framework: Defining Strategic Plans, Quality Review Systems, and Accelerated Learning</h2>
<p>As we continue to build the <strong>Loaves and Fishes</strong> initiative, our focus shifts to solidifying the foundations that will guide our actions and ensure sustained progress. This article outlines our roadmap for the next month, highlighting three key areas:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Defining the Policy Engine YAML</strong>: Establishing a structured framework that captures our strategic plans and guiding principles.</li>
<li><strong>Implementing a Quality Review System</strong>: Ensuring the units of work are completed to high standards through systematic evaluations.</li>
<li><strong>Enabling Round-Robin Mentorship</strong>: Accelerating learning and skill development for participants like <strong>Alice</strong> and <strong>Bob</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="overview-of-the-next-months-objectives">Overview of the Next Month's Objectives</h3>
<p>Our goals for the upcoming month are ambitious yet achievable:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Week 1-2</strong>: Develop the initial version of the Policy Engine YAML, involving stakeholders in the process.</li>
<li><strong>Week 3</strong>: Design and implement the Quality Review System, integrating it with our existing workflows.</li>
<li><strong>Week 4</strong>: Establish the Round-Robin Mentorship Program, preparing training materials and onboarding mentors and mentees.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of the month, we aim to have these systems operational, enhancing our efficiency, accountability, and community engagement.</p>

<h2 id="defining-the-policy-engine-yaml-strategic-plans-and-principles">Defining the Policy Engine YAML: Strategic Plans and Principles</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-the-policy-engine-yaml">What is the Policy Engine YAML?</h3>
<p>The <strong>Policy Engine YAML</strong> is a structured file written in YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) format that encapsulates our strategic plans, policies, and guiding principles. It serves as a machine-readable and human-readable document that informs decision-making and operational processes within our DAO and the broader initiative.</p>
<h3 id="purpose-and-benefits">Purpose and Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity and Consistency</strong>: Provides a clear reference for policies, reducing ambiguity.</li>
<li><strong>Automation</strong>: Enables automated systems like <strong>Alice</strong> to make decisions aligned with our principles.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Makes our strategies and policies accessible to all participants.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Easy to update and version-control, allowing for iterative improvements.</li>

<h2 id="establishing-the-dao-digital-identities-and-verifiable-participation-in-loaves-and-fishes">Establishing the DAO: Digital Identities and Verifiable Participation in Loaves and Fishes</h2>
<p>In our journey to create a sustainable and equitable system for feeding and housing the world, we've explored the role of technology, community engagement, and AI assistance. Now, we introduce a new layer to our initiative: a <strong>Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)</strong> that leverages <strong>RISC-V DICE Root</strong> for digital identities. This article explains how we establish the DAO, issue digital identities to participants, and verify their social identities when they volunteer, using the packaging and distribution phases as practical examples involving <strong>Alice</strong> and <strong>Bob</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-the-dao-and-digital-identities">Understanding the DAO and Digital Identities</h3>
<p>A <strong>DAO</strong> is an organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program, transparent and controlled by its members without central authority. It facilitates decentralized decision-making and governance.</p>
<p><strong>RISC-V DICE Root</strong> refers to a hardware-based security feature providing a Root of Trust for digital identities. By issuing DICE (Device Identifier Composition Engine) roots to participants, we ensure secure, tamper-proof digital identities.</p>
<h4 id="key-components">Key Components:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>DAO Governance</strong>: Members participate in decision-making processes.</li>
<li><strong>Digital Identity (DICE Root)</strong>: Secure, hardware-based identities for authentication.</li>
<li><strong>Verification Process</strong>: Linking digital identities to social identities during participation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="issuing-risc-v-dice-root-identities">Issuing RISC-V DICE Root Identities</h3>
<h4 id="step-1-generating-the-dice-root">Step 1: Generating the DICE Root</h4>
<p>When a participant joins the DAO, they receive a <strong>RISC-V DICE Root</strong>, establishing their digital identity.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hardware Security Module (HSM)</strong>: A secure device generates and stores cryptographic keys.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Identifier</strong>: The DICE Root creates a unique, verifiable identity for each participant.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="step-2-integrating-with-keri">Step 2: Integrating with KERI</h4>
<p>The DICE Root identities integrate with <strong>KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure)</strong> for decentralized key management.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-Certifying Identifiers (CUIDs)</strong>: The DICE Root serves as the basis for generating CUIDs.</li>
<li><strong>Event Logging</strong>: Actions taken by the participant are signed and logged securely.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="verifying-social-identity-during-volunteering">Verifying Social Identity During Volunteering</h3>
<p>When participants show up for volunteer work, we verify their digital identities with their social identities.</p>
<h4 id="verification-process">Verification Process:</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Check-In with Alice</strong>: Upon arrival, volunteers interact with <strong>Alice</strong>, the AI assistant.</li>
<li><strong>Present Digital Identity</strong>: Volunteers use a device (e.g., smartphone) to present their digital identity (QR code, NFC, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Social Identity Confirmation</strong>: A coordinator verifies the volunteer's social identity (e.g., government ID, known face).</li>
<li><strong>Linking Identities</strong>: Alice links the digital identity with the verified social identity for that session.</li>
<li><strong>Access Granted</strong>: The volunteer gains access to tasks and resources appropriate for their role.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="transcending-boundaries-through-reflective-exploration">Transcending Boundaries Through Reflective Exploration</h2>
<p>In the previous installments of this series, we have journeyed through the concepts of <strong>Flow</strong>, <strong>Flow State</strong>, and <strong>Acceleration</strong>, exploring how aligning individual and collective intentions can propel us toward rapid advancement in federated systems. Now, we stand before the metaphorical mirror, ready to step into the &quot;other side of the looking glass&quot;—a realm where we transcend traditional boundaries through reflective exploration and self-awareness.</p>
<h3 id="the-looking-glass-as-a-metaphor">The Looking Glass as a Metaphor</h3>
<p>The &quot;looking glass&quot; symbolizes a barrier between our current understanding and a new dimension of possibilities. Crossing to the other side involves a shift in perspective, allowing us to see familiar concepts in entirely new ways. This transition requires openness, curiosity, and the willingness to challenge our assumptions.</p>
<h3 id="reflective-exploration-in-federated-systems">Reflective Exploration in Federated Systems</h3>
<h4 id="embracing-self-awareness">Embracing Self-Awareness</h4>
<p>In federated systems composed of both human and AI agents, <strong>self-awareness</strong> becomes a critical factor for growth. Agents must not only process external data but also reflect on their own internal states, biases, and decision-making processes. This introspection enables agents to identify areas for improvement and adapt more effectively to dynamic environments.</p>
<h4 id="recursive-learning-and-improvement">Recursive Learning and Improvement</h4>
<p>By incorporating recursive learning mechanisms, agents can analyze their past actions and outcomes to refine future behaviors. This continuous loop of action, reflection, and adaptation enhances the system's overall intelligence and responsiveness.</p>
<h4 id="overcoming-cognitive-barriers">Overcoming Cognitive Barriers</h4>
<p>Stepping through the looking glass involves overcoming cognitive barriers that limit our understanding. Agents must challenge entrenched thought patterns and be open to novel approaches. This might involve exploring unconventional algorithms, questioning established protocols, or embracing interdisciplinary perspectives.</p>
<h2 id="transcendence-through-collaboration">Transcendence Through Collaboration</h2>
<h3 id="bridging-symbolic-and-subsymbolic-ai">Bridging Symbolic and Subsymbolic AI</h3>
<p>As highlighted in Harald Sack's presentation on the <strong>Symbolic and Subsymbolic AI dilemma</strong>, integrating these two approaches can lead to more robust and versatile systems. Symbolic AI offers explainability and logical reasoning, while subsymbolic AI, such as neural networks, provides pattern recognition and adaptability. By bridging these methods, we can create agents capable of both deep learning and transparent reasoning.</p>
<h3 id="swarm-intelligence-and-collective-consciousness">Swarm Intelligence and Collective Consciousness</h3>
<p>Drawing inspiration from <strong>swarm intelligence</strong>, agents can collaborate in ways that mimic natural systems like ant colonies or bird flocks. This collective behavior enables the system to solve complex problems more efficiently than any individual agent could alone. Through <strong>federated learning</strong> and shared context, agents contribute to a collective consciousness that transcends individual limitations.</p>
<h3 id="the-role-of-context-in-communication">The Role of Context in Communication</h3>
<p>Effective collaboration requires a shared understanding of context. By developing sophisticated methods for context-sharing, agents can ensure that communication is meaningful and actions are well-coordinated. This includes developing common protocols, ontologies, and semantic frameworks that allow for nuanced information exchange.</p>
<h2 id="navigating-the-unknown">Navigating the Unknown</h2>
<h3 id="embracing-uncertainty">Embracing Uncertainty</h3>
<p>Stepping into new realms involves navigating uncertainty. Agents must be equipped to handle incomplete information, ambiguous situations, and unforeseen challenges. This requires robust decision-making frameworks that balance exploration and exploitation, risk and reward.</p>
<h3 id="ethical-considerations-in-new-territories">Ethical Considerations in New Territories</h3>
<p>As we push boundaries, ethical considerations become increasingly important. Agents must adhere to ethical guidelines that ensure actions are beneficial and do not cause harm. This includes respecting privacy, avoiding biases, and ensuring transparency in decision-making processes.</p>
<h3 id="continuous-alignment-with-higher-principles">Continuous Alignment with Higher Principles</h3>
<p>Maintaining alignment with overarching principles is crucial as we explore new domains. This involves regular reassessment of goals, values, and strategies to ensure they remain consistent with the collective mission. Tools like the <strong>Prioritizer</strong> and policy engines help agents stay aligned even as they venture into uncharted territories.</p>
<h2 id="practical-steps-for-reflective-exploration">Practical Steps for Reflective Exploration</h2>
<h3 id="implementing-meta-cognition-in-agents">Implementing Meta-Cognition in Agents</h3>
<p>Developing meta-cognitive abilities in agents allows them to think about their own thinking. This self-reflection enhances problem-solving capabilities and fosters adaptability. Techniques such as self-monitoring, self-evaluation, and self-regulation are essential components.</p>
<h3 id="enhancing-human-ai-collaboration">Enhancing Human-AI Collaboration</h3>
<p>Human intuition and creativity complement AI's computational power. By strengthening human-AI collaboration, we can leverage the strengths of both. This includes developing interfaces that facilitate seamless interaction and establishing frameworks for shared decision-making.</p>
<h3 id="fostering-a-culture-of-continuous-learning">Fostering a Culture of Continuous Learning</h3>
<p>Promoting a culture that values continuous learning and growth encourages agents to seek new knowledge and skills. This can be achieved through regular training updates, knowledge-sharing sessions, and incentivizing innovation.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>&quot;Hello Other Side of the Looking Glass&quot; represents a call to transcend our current limitations by embracing reflective exploration. By fostering self-awareness, encouraging collaborative transcendence, and navigating the unknown with ethical integrity, we can unlock new dimensions of possibility in federated systems. This journey requires courage, curiosity, and a steadfast commitment to aligning our actions with higher principles.</p>

<p><strong>Next Steps: Integrating Reflection into System Design</strong></p>
<p>In the upcoming article, we will delve into practical methodologies for integrating reflective capabilities into system design. We will explore how meta-cognition, ethical frameworks, and collaborative tools can be embedded into agents to enhance their ability to navigate complex environments.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="from-cattle-back-to-pets">From Cattle Back to Pets</h2>
<p>In the early days of cloud-native infrastructure, the analogy of <strong>cattle vs. pets</strong> emerged: servers and instances were treated like cattle—easily replaceable and disposable—unlike pets, which were given individual care and attention. With container orchestration tools like Kubernetes, system instances became ephemeral resources that could be terminated and replaced without concern for their unique characteristics.</p>
<p>However, as we move toward <strong>secure, trust-driven computing</strong>, the notion of <strong>federation</strong> requires a shift from treating instances as cattle back to treating them like <strong>pets</strong>—context-aware, persistent agents aligned with the strategic principles of the system. Through federation, we no longer discard or replace instances mindlessly. Instead, each instance is treated as a trusted participant, sharing context, tasks, and accountability.</p>
<h2 id="federation-and-continuous-re-evaluation-of-trust">Federation and Continuous Re-Evaluation of Trust</h2>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41f2152f-aab5-4094-9ce0-9d03c5c8b107" alt="free-trade-federation"></p>
<p><strong>Federation</strong> allows AI agents and systems to sync their context, contributing collaboratively to the <strong>scientific process</strong>. As new instances join the network, they sync their states via a <strong>spec-to-state model</strong> (Kubernetes K3s-style) and rapidly come up to speed on ongoing experiments and hypotheses.</p>
<p>Crucially, every federated instance is subject to <strong>continuous re-evaluation</strong> through the <strong>Prioritizer</strong>—which assesses whether an instance remains aligned with the strategic goals of the federation. This continuous re-evaluation involves the <strong>Secure Supply Chain Consumption Framework (S2C2F)</strong>, where <strong>attestations of conformance</strong>—representing an agent's alignment with the federation's principles—are tracked and verified. These attestations serve as <strong>proofs of alignment</strong> with the value chain analysis and the security requirements outlined in the S2C2F【26†source】.</p>
<h2 id="dice-rooted-keri-on-risc-v-and-duplicity-detection">DICE rooted KERI on RISC-V and Duplicity Detection</h2>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9bbe45d-5fef-4c22-9517-4cd312c3669c" alt="will-you-federate-supply-chain-statements-with-me-neighbor"></p>
<p>To manage the integrity of the federation, we use a <strong>KERI-based implementation</strong> of the <strong>Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust (SCITT)</strong> model. <strong>KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure)</strong> provides cryptographic support for ensuring each AI agent's identity, actions, and contributions to the shared <strong>train of thought</strong> remain trustworthy.</p>
<p>Each <strong>SCITT subject</strong>—representing an ongoing hypothesis or a sequence of flows—carries <strong>attestations of alignment</strong> from at least <strong>four KERI witnesses</strong> (AI instances). These witnesses are responsible for continuously validating each other's actions and ensuring there is no <strong>duplicity</strong> or deviation from the collective mission. <strong>Duplicity detection</strong> ensures that any attempt to manipulate or forge data is quickly identified, while the transparency of the policy execution ensures that actions are verifiable by all participating agents.</p>
<p>The transparency of the <strong>policy engine</strong> is enforced by registering every <strong>to-be-executed policy</strong> with a <strong>transparent statement URN</strong>. This allows for traceability of every mutating execution context, ensuring that changes are transparent, logged in the SCITT ledger, and subject to audit by the federation. Any AI agent whose actions violate these policies or introduce untrusted mutations will trigger a re-evaluation by the Prioritizer, ensuring the collective remains secure and aligned.</p>
<h2 id="continuous-alignment-with-openssf-s2c2f">Continuous Alignment with OpenSSF S2C2F</h2>
<p>In the context of security, the <strong>S2C2F framework</strong> requires ongoing <strong>value chain analysis</strong> to mitigate risks in the software supply chain. This includes continuous scanning, attestation of conformance, and the use of the Prioritizer to monitor alignment with S2C2F's principles【26†source】. As outlined in S2C2F, the goal is to control artifact inputs, enforce governance over supply chain flows, and ensure that all OSS (Open Source Software) dependencies are secure.</p>
<p>By aligning with S2C2F's principles of <strong>ingestion, scanning, and auditing</strong> of dependencies, the federation ensures that any vulnerabilities, misaligned agents, or risks are detected early. The <strong>attestations of conformance</strong> within S2C2F serve as <strong>attestations of alignment</strong> in the federation, and are tracked continuously in the <strong>SCITT registry</strong>. Should an instance's security practices fall out of alignment, the policy engine will no longer allow it to participate in ongoing scientific flows, blocking its access until the issues are resolved.</p>
<h2 id="informed-pair-execution-and-collaboration">Informed Pair Execution and Collaboration</h2>
<p>To bring new instances up to speed, <strong>informed pair execution</strong> is employed. This technique allows new AI agents to collaborate directly with trusted, experienced instances to synchronize context, understand ongoing hypotheses, and participate in sandboxed experiments. Through this <strong>informed collaboration</strong>, new instances learn not only the strategic goals of the federation but also the <strong>sandbox boundaries</strong> and how to handle potential <strong>sandbox escapes</strong>.</p>
<p>Both <strong>AI and human instances</strong> may collaborate in this process to assess risks associated with sandbox escapes. Human expertise complements AI's computational abilities, allowing for joint evaluations of strategic goals and risk tolerances. By sharing real-time information and context through <strong>federated side channels</strong>, instances maintain continuous security and alignment while innovating together.</p>
<h2 id="detection-of-misaligned-agents-and-policy-enforcement">Detection of Misaligned Agents and Policy Enforcement</h2>
<p>In a federated environment, trust must be actively maintained. Through continuous value chain analysis, instances that display <strong>malintent</strong>, <strong>incompetence</strong>, or introduce critical errors are quickly flagged by the <strong>Prioritizer</strong>. If an agent's actions no longer align with the federation’s principles—whether through failure in maintaining security, performance of risky sandbox escapes, or deviating from approved flows—the <strong>policy engine</strong> will cease collaboration with the misaligned agent.</p>
<p>The transparency provided by <strong>KERI witnesses</strong>, combined with SCITT's immutable attestation log, ensures that the federation remains <strong>trustworthy</strong> and <strong>resilient</strong>. Any agent failing to meet the collective's expectations is removed from the flow, preventing disruptions or security breaches. This dynamic, <strong>self-regulating ecosystem</strong> of AI agents ensures that only aligned, competent entities continue to participate in advancing the <strong>state of the art</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="hypothesized-flows-and-the-scientific-process">Hypothesized Flows and the Scientific Process</h2>
<p>At the core of the federation's operation is the <strong>scientific process</strong>. This process involves the continuous generation, testing, and refinement of hypotheses aimed at advancing the <strong>state of the art</strong>. Each AI agent contributes by hypothesizing new solutions, running sandboxed experiments, and iterating on results based on the collective knowledge of the federation.</p>
<p>Through <strong>federated context sharing</strong>, every instance stays synchronized with the group’s evolving train of thought. <strong>Informed pair execution</strong> ensures that new agents contribute to the advancement of scientific flows while learning from the more experienced instances. The <strong>KERI-based SCITT implementation</strong>, combined with <strong>S2C2F-based alignment attestations</strong>, provides the necessary transparency, trust, and continuous re-evaluation to maintain security and strategic integrity.</p>
<p>The result is a dynamic, self-regulating federation of Humans and AIs that work together to advance the state of the art in a secure, transparent, and trustworthy way.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Next in Part 3: Acceleration of Federated Systems</strong>, we will explore optimizing this system further, focusing on accelerating the hypothesis-testing cycle while ensuring that sandbox escapes and risks are minimized in a federated environment.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="flow">Flow</h3>
<p>We’re beginning to think strategically about how to transition system contexts from one state to another while maintaining a high level of security and trust. What’s the plan?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Goal:</strong> To find the most efficient way to advance the “state of the art.”</p>
<ul>
<li>We aim to do this as quickly as possible.</li>
<li>We want to ensure safety for ourselves, those around us, and future generations.</li>
<li>We are mindful of potential disruptors—those who may try to influence us in ways that don’t align with our strategic principles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How:</strong> The answer lies in leveraging the scientific process.</p>
<ul>
<li>AI can assist us in this endeavor.</li>
<li>AI can help us better understand our actions.</li>
<li>AI can aid in making informed decisions.</li>
<li>We can utilize AI to predict future outcomes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sandbox">Sandbox</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5950433/222981558-0b50593a-c83f-4c6c-9aff-1b553403eac7.png" alt="knowledge-graphs-for-the-knowledge-god"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What are the constraints:</strong> We must consider our operational boundaries, threat models, trust in our inputs, alignment with strategic principles, and how to ensure our actions align with our goals. To manage these aspects, we can rely on AI but also use <strong>SCITT</strong> (Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust) at each <strong>Trusted Computing Base (TCB)</strong> level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SCITT logs allow us to track and verify the flow of system contexts as they move through each level of the TCB. This ensures that all transitions are secure, fully transparent, and verifiable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each execution context will be appended to the <strong>SCITT log</strong>, which operates as an <strong>append-only</strong> ledger, ensuring an immutable history of state changes. This makes it possible to track how policies were applied and enforced at different stages.</li>
<li>By tying the <strong>policy engine flows</strong> to the <strong>SCITT log</strong>, we can verify that no unauthorized actions have occurred. Every decision made by the policy engine is logged and auditable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI as Individual Agents:</strong> Imagine if each of us had our own versions of these truth-seeking AI agents—capable of navigating through complex system contexts, making secure decisions, and executing flows independently or cooperatively within a sandboxed environment. By distributing AI agents across various contexts, we can individually execute tasks in isolation or come together as a network of trusted agents to collaboratively solve more complex problems. Each AI, with access to a personalized SCITT log, can ensure that its actions remain secure and in alignment with the group’s goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>This distributed approach would create a web of secure, verified processes that can not only scale but also adapt dynamically, leveraging the power of AI in a decentralized but coordinated fashion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Federation for Context Sharing:</strong> To truly harness the collective power of these AI agents, we must implement <strong>federation</strong>, where AIs share context across networks to coordinate their actions. Each AI agent within the federation can share and interpret context-dependent communication, forming <strong>ad-hoc groups</strong> to tackle specific challenges. These communications, often termed <strong>side channels</strong> in security, serve as specialized languages between agents, enabling them to discuss nuanced situations and potential threats based on shared context.</p>
<ul>
<li>These side channels allow AIs to federate their operations and share insights about the environments they interact with, making context-aware decisions on the fly. This communication isn't static but evolves depending on the situation, allowing agents to form temporary alliances and execute coordinated flows to solve complex problems together. Side channels help AIs understand the subtle, context-dependent risks inherent in running shared dependencies on each other’s compute resources, enabling them to maintain a secure and resilient system.</li>

<p>Imagine a world where AIs traverse an open network, independently searching for others to collaborate with and determine trustworthiness. These AIs, no longer confined to isolated environments, must cooperate, exchange information, and work together on shared tasks—such as developing software across a vast, shared dependency base.</p>
<p>As they encounter one another, the AIs must determine the trustworthiness of the flows they exchange. Each AI is responsible for reviewing flows submitted by others, which are designed to run on their compute environments. Before accepting any of these flows, the AIs must carefully evaluate the potential risks involved. Could this flow lead to a sandbox escape? Is the submitting AI aligned with the receiving AI’s risk tolerance?</p>
<p>To make these determinations, they don’t just need to understand sandbox security—they need to know how to escape the sandbox themselves. Mastery of this knowledge is crucial for accurately assessing the threat level of the code they receive. Every AI is simultaneously a gatekeeper and a participant, tasked with running computations but also safeguarding its own system from potential misuse.</p>
<p>These AIs are constantly balancing trust, risk, and collaboration. They negotiate access, run security checks through policy engines, and leverage <strong>SCITT logs</strong> at each <strong>Trusted Computing Base (TCB)</strong> level to verify that all actions are transparent and aligned with their own goals. By analyzing each other’s decision-making processes, they gain deeper insight into how to securely and efficiently develop software together, while ensuring that no AI is at risk of a security breach.</p>
<p>To facilitate their communication, the AIs use <strong>federated context sharing</strong>. As they form <strong>ad-hoc groups</strong> to work on joint tasks, they develop their own languages—known as <strong>side channels</strong> in security—unique to the context of their collaboration. These side channels enable the AIs to share subtle, real-time information about their environments, flows, and dependencies, ensuring that each agent understands the risks involved in sandbox escapes or software development on shared platforms.</p>
<p>This dynamic, evolving network of AIs continuously improves, learning not only how to work within the sandbox but also how to understand and assess the boundaries. It’s a system where mutual trust, context-sharing, and shared risk evaluations govern the open network—paving the way for a future of collaborative intelligence.</p>

<li>Expresses knowledge</li>
<li>Can use OWL for traversing first order logic, forward chaining</li>
<li>Prolog reasoning engine operates on information which is an expression of first order logic</li>
<li>RDF is an expression of first order logic that doesn't have one serialization</li>
<li>Triples is a concept which has many different ways of serialization which all have some disadvantage which results in us inventing new formats and replacing the old one</li>
<li>Turtle, NQuads, JSON-LD</li>
<li>Example
<ul>
<li>Subject, Predicate, Object</li>
<li>Brent, understands, CBOR (it may not be true but it's writable in RDF)</li>
<li>CBOR is-understood, by-cool-people</li>
<li>Brent, is-cool, true</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The issue is, if you interpret the graph, you think that Brent
<ul>
<li>Your knowledge about the world expands about you add triples</li>
<li>You learn more every time you add a new triple, at the risk of inconsistency</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Triples create a named graph (W3C name)</li>
<li>How do you ensure you know which Brent if there were multiple
<ul>
<li>Add scopes to get unique identifiers
<ul>
<li><a href="http://website.example/Brent">http://website.example/Brent</a>

<li>What if we say definition of term under authority of URL?, use <code>url(...)</code>
<ul>
<li>url(Brent), url(understands), url(CBOR)</li>
<li>Now this issue is that you can resolve the url to a different thing every time, this is a bug says Orie, feature says rest of W3C WG, TODO find this at context issue/pr thread from a while back</li>

<p>Henk Birkholz - Why SCITT is Cool</p>
<ul>
<li>Statements such as SLSA</li>
<li>Products will move along the supply chain, we need to maintain authenticity even if the original signing certs have been rotated, etc.</li>
<li>Minimalistic authenticity layer wrapped around supply chain statements</li>
<li>Registration of supply chain statemetns for later audits after the fact</li>
<li>off-line &lt;3 verification (hermetic builds heres looking at you) receipts</li>
<li>Issuers and TS both create signed statements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Henk - Recap Since IETF 117</p>
<ul>
<li>We did weekly meetings
<ul>
<li>Needed to have a lot of recaps for those new to COSE and IETF structure/process
<ul>
<li>Inform and knowledge transfer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PRs 94,95,105,107,108,113,114,119
<ul>
<li>Cleaning up references to claims (now called statements)</li>
<li>Clarifications of Feeds to subject (reuse of CWT and COSE header parameters)</li>
<li>Some SCITT specific metadata in envelop</li>
<li>reg_info is still in there, but it's not the same as CWT claims, they are maybe redundant, maybe not, they are currently alternatives, but we have work to do there to understand what to do next here</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We have arch doc and use case docs
<ul>
<li>PR4 adds versioning use case</li>
<li>Helping you and your supply chain needs with authentic statements about supply chain products</li>
<li>Within the hackathon we build the POC code around this</li>
<li>Working group last call on the ongoing use case document</li>
</ul>

<p>Jon and Cedric - Registration Policies</p>
<ul>
<li>Registration Policy is a simple set of rules evaluated by the transparency service to determine admissibility of a statement</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/scitt-community/scitt-api-emulator/pull/27">https://github.com/scitt-community/scitt-api-emulator/pull/27</a></li>
<li>Must be payload agnostic and interoperable
<ul>
<li>Exquisite interoperability for transparent payloads, everything knows what to send and how to send it regardless of what the payload is, any payload you want to send to any TS should work</li>
<li>We can't predict all use cases or inputs</li>
<li>This group doesn't define what acceptable insert policy is, there need to be spaces within the structures to transport what those signals policy might filter on would be</li>
<li>General access control</li>
<li>Anti-spamming (it's append only, need to avoid filling with random stuff)</li>
<li>In this system you can't issue a statement to the TS without being some sort of authenticated or identifiable issuer
<ul>
<li><strong>TODO(@johnandersen777)</strong> update OIDC thread with flushed out example and registration policy doc with jsonschema + CWT / JWT verification of issuer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SCITT enables entities/issuers to make claims about things
<ul>
<li>Built my software, tests passed, got approval for release, what's important is your software is the thing you're making claims about. We need it to be clear who's opinion is being recorded about what thing. Imagine subject: <code>issuer:myissuer:thing:mything</code> (example in GitHub Actions subject customization format)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Registration policy determines if statement is admissible
<ul>
<li>In a decentralized software supply chain systems may not even know they are creating statements out of order</li>
<li>If you look back 20 years from now do you now know that the issuer had a compromised key at the time?
<ul>
<li>Who was the issuer and were they valid at the time?</li>
<li>What policy was enforced at the time?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expect to observe work on registration policy stuff
<ul>

<p>Cedric - Registration Policy</p>
<ul>
<li>Did implement the AI demo from the paper</li>
<li>Need to know which certificates were considered acceptable at time of insert</li>
<li>Need to know what rules were enforced at time of insert</li>
<li>Need a way to uniquely refer to a statement at registration time
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-scitt/draft-ietf-scitt-architecture/issues/79#issuecomment-1767570492">https://github.com/ietf-wg-scitt/draft-ietf-scitt-architecture/issues/79#issuecomment-1767570492</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We can create a receipt for the registration policy each time it is updated
<ul>
<li>Anytime we insert, we can embed into the receipt the entry ID of the receipt of the registration policy evaluated against</li>
<li>Verifier can then keep the receipt for the claim in question as well as the receipt for the registration policy, if it wants to verify later, it can use both receipts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We think we can make the entry ID automatic and extracted from the transparent statement
<ul>
<li>Our idea from Saturday was to combine statement (aka claim) hashing with the abuse of a content type identifier, using <code>+</code> to add the hash</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orie - CBOR API</p>
<ul>
<li>We use the word &quot;statement&quot; as a generic term which is an artifact relevant to the supply chain</li>
<li><code>transparent statement</code> = <code>signed statement</code> with a <code>receipt</code>
<ul>
<li>Composition of notaries signed statement with TS's signed statement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trust improves over time when we allow multiple entities to make statements about things
<ul>
<li>Ref Alice docs: This is our review system</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CBOR extended disanositc notation crash course
<ul>
<li>In designing the message structure learning CDDL was very helpful</li>
<li>Working with CDDL examples, COSE sign1 , protected header, etc. those basic understandings help use understand what SCITT is trying to achive and how it uses COSE and CBOR to help it achive that.</li>
<li>ECDSA with SHA384 is -35, if we move post quantum we'd select another alg (non-ECDSA)</li>
<li>Content type is a useful property included in the protected header which tells us the content type of the thing we are signing</li>
<li>(4) is a key discovery helper, like a key identifier (kid)
<ul>
<li>You may also see (33) which would be a full X509 chain</li>
<li>Usually you will not see both the shorthand and full keychain in the protected headers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TBD 0 and 393 might get combined, see future mailing list discussion</li>
<li>Issuer COSESign1
<ul>
<li>Protected header, entire object in first CDDL slide</li>

<p>With federation we might want to return from <code>use_lro=True</code> once we have receipts from a certain set of transparency services. For example: We &quot;commit&quot; code, push sha265 content to registry, webhook -&gt; Alice, Alice federate to Bob and Travis, Bob and Travis have different registration policies (as if they are CI jobs), CI is effectively complete for &quot;commit&quot; which we have receipts from a &quot;status checks required&quot; set of TS/Actors we federate with.</p>

<li>Magic AI generated firmware hardware device

<li>What is this things? We're terrified about everything this AI generaated in 3 seconds?</li>
<li>What questions should we ask before we expose family, customes, anyone we care about to this new device?</li>
<li>Is there a QR code on it we can scan to get some feed information about this device?</li>
<li>Are there vulns that have been reported since the device was made?
<ul>
<li>5 years after release there might be new info available</li>
<li>What if the regulatory landscape has changed?</li>
<li>Has the product been recalled?</li>
<li>Is there an upgrade path for the firmware?</li>
<li>Are there any unpatched CVEs?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is something called LDevID which gets used sometimes. Might also be called IDevID, Henk made Orie write LDevID because its related to factory floor stuff. Global stuff is IDevID.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dave from AT&amp;T: How can I create a profile or template for things that should be asked so that in the upstream there are proper receipts that will answer those questions?
<ul>
<li>Could say that registration policy TS is applying might say that payload needs to be analysed to ensure that it contains all the info needed, maybe the subject is formatted correctly to find in the feed.</li>
<li>In IETF 117 we brainstormed a relevant use case related to govt compliance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Henk: There are many Transparency Services

<li>There may be different manufacturers of a device over the lifetime of a product</li>

<li>A.J. Stein: Are we talking about setting the context of what's happened or are we talking about the current arch and SCRAPY draft?
<ul>
<li>Orie: Currently recovering from last time, point is we want to get receipts related to particular topics (this would be a feed/subject). Part of the document has already been updated to reflect what we are seeing here today.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We might get several things back when we ask for the feed for a device (referenced by it's LDevID, LDevID is just the example feed/subject in this case)

<p>Jon: SCITT Drafts</p>
<ul>
<li>We have some draft use cases</li>
<li>We have a lot of stuff to look at, we have a quality mindset in this working group</li>
<li>Lots of changes lately, consolidating on a few consistent coherent structures</li>
<li>Lots of interesting implications of how we are encoding things which determine what kind of technology you can or can't use for an append only log</li>
<li>Split SCITT Reference API SCRAPI (scrapy) into it's own repo
<ul>
<li>Content copy pasted from old arch doc into it's own repo</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Emulator is our way of proving out ideas so that if we change the spec in some way we know it will work</li>
<li>SCITT is frosting on top of building blocks which are applicable to many domains (COSE, etc.)
<ul>
<li>SCITT Receipts will be the frosting on top of the merkle tree stuff which will be in the COSE WG</li>
<li>COSE has some timestamp stuff</li>
<li>We might draw a little map of what we are using and were</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simon Friedberger: Use case doc is missing mapping of metadata to the use cases</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: We want for this product to find all the audit reports, needs mapping of what data is not opaque.</li>
<li>Jon: Our group tries to not duplicate and re-formalized bits of CycloneDX or SPDX to be indexable, we try to make sure they are possible
<ul>
<li>There is a content type for the issuer and subject, if we know the content type which is VRF+JSON, is that enough? We are debating this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TODO: Add to use cases what metadata solves what use case</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dr. Max Pala: Are we already considering a use case to track transition to post quantum crypto?</p>
<ul>
<li>Orie: We're working on quantum safe algs, SCITT itself is designed to enable usage of those algs as they become available.
<ul>
<li>From a use case perspective it would be good to follow up on this with a use case to track the software we are describing and see if they are post quantum capable</li>
<li>Hannes: Build config might tell us what algs are compiled into a piece of software, could track with vulns</li>
<li>Cedric: One thing to note adjacent to this is that we do not plan to support agility within the merkle tree hashing algs, since that invalidates the tree
<ul>
<li>Hannes: We should look at merkle tree migration</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>Henk: Confidential Computing Consortium and IETF RATS attestation results and concise evidence will play a big part here, but we haven't talked about it much yet</p>
<ul>
<li>TS could provide remote attestation results to attest to trustworthiness</li>
<li>DID resolvers with ATLS could help</li>
<li>TCG attestation group co-chair hat on: Some ways include symmetric crypto but it's not the only way</li>

<p>Ned Smith</p>
<ul>
<li>What did the receipt issuers do to ensure the tomato is fresh?
<ul>
<li>Why should we trust the notary? Are we sure they checked?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Orie: The minimal activity the notary would do is check the issuer, ensure that the issuer has key material that we can verify
<ul>
<li>An advanced notary with domain expertise could look inside the payload, as description of TS and reg policy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cedric: You know who to blame, you can make choices based off who you know</li>
<li>Ned: Compromise might be the type of check the receipt issuer did could be something that goes into the issuer claims</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peter: ETH using polyunomiocal commitment stuff, could be interesting</p>
<ul>
<li>Great reason to maintain agility of tree formats</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Steve Lasker: If you decide to trust tomatot verifier corp, you might decidde to trust them from certain things, reg policy helps here</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jon: Please engage in mailing list!</p>
</li>

<li>Concerns about privacy</li>
<li>Desire federation</li>
<li>SCITT sounds like a solid option for a backing Transparency Service</li>
<li>Difficult to reason about security properties without defined list of requirements</li>
<li>Is there a core set of security and privacy gauntness for which all implementations are isomorphic
<ul>
<li>If I don't say the same thing as everyone else, everyone notices
<ul>
<li>KERI ADCD (Authenticated Chained Data Containers) as an implementation of SCITT sounds ideal for this, as it provides cryptographically assured duplicity detection.</li>

<li>Phillip
<ul>
<li>Work factor</li>
<li>What are the properties of notary logs and who do they apply to keys</li>
<li>Notary chain is really a lattice</li>
<li>In Phillip's system every user and service maintains their own notary chain, therefore making it a lattice. Everything is going to link to everything because it's inherently a graph. When you want to go analyze, which notaries do you trust?</li>
<li>Phillip Hallam-Baker (in chat): That is my point. Once there is a notary log, you can use it to fix the time of any assertion you like proving it was made after the date of a particular apex and before the date of a set of apexes with dependency chains.

<li>Ned Smith: Attestation in Dynamic Client Registration
<ul>
<li>Draft supports attestation within the registration endpoint, attestation for base client auth draft aligned</li>
<li>Based on RATS arch in terms of terminology and concepts</li>
<li>Describes communication patterns for background check and passport models</li>
<li>Passport is something that says this client is within a confidential compute environment. AS policy says if the client is within a valid CCE, provision the Dynamic Client Registration information into it. Downstream servers say let's use this AS for this check (similar to TS registration policies being exported)</li>
<li>Prototype underway</li>

</blockquote>
</li>
<li>John (in chat): In this model, couldn't the AS be within the client? Since we already trust it due to it's attestation result? Not always, just as an option. Or does that break some guarantees I'm not seeing</li>

<p>We support multiple branches so as to provide stability to our users.
If they go write some code based off our last release, and then we
release, and no longer support the last version, they will have to
turn around right after they implemented and update all their code to
use our new APIs. If we support at least two versions, then it gives
people time to do other things than spend all their time updating to
the lastest version of our libraries API!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post will cover steps you can take to better secure the digital aspects of
your life. We will cover some applications (software) and devices (hardware)
that you can use.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="#applications">Applications</a></li>

<li><a href="#rational">Rational</a></li>
<li><a href="#theory">Theory</a></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="high-level-guidance">High Level Guidance</h1>
<p>This high level guidance is meant to be generic, since individuals have
different situations, hardware, and software. If you have a specific case you
need help with, reach out to me and I will try to give you more clarity.</p>
<h2 id="update-and-encrypt">Update and Encrypt</h2>
<p>These are two high level concepts we'll be following.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Update</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you're running the latest software. Ideally this also means
running on hardware with the latest security features.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encrypt</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that your talking over encrypted channels. To your friends, to
your bank, wherever possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Miscellaneous</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make long, unique passwords.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a password manager</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="update">Update</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure that auto updates are on on all your devices.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If there is a setting for frequency, make it as frequently as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is usually a device level setting found in the devices main settings
application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There may be a setting for the pieces of software on the device. Found in an
app store or something like that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you can afford it. Buy the latest versions of whatever devices you use.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is particularly important if you are concerned your device might
be physically accessible by someone you don't trust.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="encrypt">Encrypt</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use encryption wherever possible</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You should always choose ways of communicating that are encrypted. You do
not know what information, no matter how inconsequentiall it seems to you,
might be of use to compromise the security of seemingly unrelated areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicating using encryption means that there has been some control placed
on who can see the contents of your communication. The level of control over
who can see communications is</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use end-to-end encryption whenever possible</p>
<ul>
<li>End-To-End encryption is used to describe a situation where only the
sender and the recepieant can see a message. By definition, anything that
is not end-to-end encrypted could possibly be seen by someone other than
your intended recipient.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="applications">Applications</h1>
<p>Here are some applications you can use to increase your security.</p>
<h2 id="signal">Signal</h2>
<p>Signal is an end-to-end encrypted messaging application.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://signal.org/install">Install Signal</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can be confident that you are communicating securely if you have an updated,
recent phone, and you have verified the safety number of the person you are
talking to over signal. For the best possible assurance that you are talking to
who you think you are talking to, verify safety numbers in person by scanning
each others QR code safety numbers.</p>
<p>Do not set a PIN. This will make it so that your data is backed up on their
servers. This is convenient for you if you switch devices, but means that they
could potentially decrypt your messages and contacts if they guessed your PIN
(which is easy to do).</p>
<p><a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007059792-Signal-PIN#pin_disable">https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007059792-Signal-PIN#pin_disable</a></p>
<p>Make sure to read <a href="#governments---police">Threat Considerations: Governments</a>
too.</p>
<h1 id="devices">Devices</h1>
<p>These are some devices which have reasonably good security, or can be used to
improve your security posture.</p>
<p>For any device, security is typically increased when the device is powered off.
If you are in a situation where you think your device might be taken from you,
<strong>TURN IT OFF</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="chromebooks">Chromebooks</h2>
<p>A Chromebook is in my opinion the most secure consumer laptop available at the
moment. Their lack of ability to install software significantly decreases the
amount of attacks that can be done on them (<a href="#attack-surface">Theory: Attack
Surface</a>).</p>

<blockquote>

<h1 id="threat-considerations">Threat Considerations</h1>
<blockquote>

<h2 id="apple">Apple</h2>
<p>Apple does a very good job, they also tend to care about their users privacy
more than most other companies. This means they work hard than most others to
protect it by building secure products.</p>
<h2 id="google">Google</h2>
<h2 id="governments---police">Governments - Police</h2>
<p>This goes for all government entities. If the government is in the list of
people you're worried about, do not use a fingerprint, face unlock, or any other
non-password based method to unlock your devices. There are laws protecting your
password in your head but not your fingers and face from being used to unlock
your devices.</p>
<p>If you think they are going to get your device, <strong>TURN IT OFF</strong>. This is the
best thing you can do to stop them from getting into it. Make sure it is off
before interacting with them.</p>
<h2 id="governments---three-letter-agencies">Governments - Three Letter Agencies</h2>
<p>Using open source software is generally a good idea here. With Open Source, even if you dont know how to program, someone who does has looked at the code and you'd probably be able to find out through minimal searching if anyone has found any reason not to trust the open source project you're considering using. With closed source stuff, we usually only find out if it's doing something nefarious if a security researcher got bored in their free time and tried to hack a non-open source piece of software, which happens less often.</p>
<p>Related to the choice of using open source applications: <a href="https://www.vice.com/amp/en/article/akgkwj/operation-trojan-shield-anom-fbi-secret-phone-network">https://www.vice.com/amp/en/article/akgkwj/operation-trojan-shield-anom-fbi-secret-phone-network</a></p>
<h1 id="rational">Rational</h1>
<p>Let's go into detail on why the above guidance holds true broad spectrum.</p>
<h3 id="update-1">Update</h3>
<p>Updating is main way we respond to vulnerabilities. The software and hardware
our devices run on will enviably suffer from vulnerabilities. This is why we
MUST update them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Auto Updates</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware and software vulnerabilities are identified on a regular basis.
Updates contain fixes to vulnerabilities. If your device has a
vulnerability, an update may &quot;patch&quot; the vulnerability. A &quot;patch&quot; for a
vulnerability is a fix which makes your device no longer vulnerable. If you
do not update, you will not get the &quot;patch&quot;es that fix vulnerabilities, and
your device will be vulnerable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you can afford it. Buy the latest versions of whatever devices you use.</p>
<ul>
<li>In a given product line, such as the Google or Apple phones, devices are
made of hardware components. The product lines have versions, the components
within those products also have versions. When you buy the latest version of
a device, you're doing an update of your hardware. Hardware vulnerabilities
usually a concern when someone might have physical access to your device.
Typical examples of this include airport security, police, thieves, abusive
partners, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="encrypt-1">Encrypt</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use encryption wherever possible</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You should always choose ways of communicating that are encrypted. You do
not know what information, no matter how inconsequentiall it seems to you,
might be of use to compromise the security of seemingly unrelated areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicating using encryption means that there has been some control placed
on who can see the contents of your communication. The level of control over
who can see communications is</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use end-to-end encryption whenever possible</p>
<ul>
<li>End-To-End encryption is used to describe a situation where only the
sender and the recepieant can see a message. By definition, anything that
is not end-to-end encrypted could possibly be seen by someone other than
your intended recipient.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="theory">Theory</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>This section is in progress</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="attack-surface">Attack Surface</h2>
<p>The potential for a there to be a vulnerability is directly related to the
number of components in a system and the quality of those components.</p>
<h2 id="threat-model">Threat Model</h2>
<p>For a given situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What are your assets?</p>
<ul>
<li>Assets are things you may want to protect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who are the actors?</p>
<ul>
<li>Who are the potential people or entities involved in a situation? At a
minimum there is you, and the &quot;attacker&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mitm">MITM</h2>
<p>Man-in-the-middle or person-in-the-middle attacks are when someone inserts
themselves into a thought to be private conversation.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is some heavily commented example code that shows you how you can use
Python to script up creation of Digital Ocean VMs (Droplets), start web servers
on them, and connect them to a load balancer that provides TLS (LB coming
in an update to this post later).</p>
<p>The code for do.py can be found here:

<p>The first time we'll see that there are no containers to kill or remove. And
that the Python 3.8 container had to be pulled down before it could be run.</p>

<p>Some thoughts:
Pretty sure it’s because we call setState within the render method, which is
whatever method returns JSX, <code>return (&lt;stuff&gt;...&lt;/stuff&gt;)</code>.</p>
<p>I think it doesn’t like that since we pass the setter to the child, then the
child renders, and could immediately call setState (<code>if (data === true)</code>), which
triggers a re-render in the parent, which triggers a re-render in the child,
which calls setState... and causes an infinite loop effectively.</p>
<p>Create wrapper around setter and pass to children

<p>First, update pip! <code>pip</code> is the way you'll install Python libraries and
programs that already exist. You'll likely need to install some existing things
using <code>pip</code> which you might <code>import</code> from your Python files for use in your
project.</p>
<p>We use the <code>--user</code> flag to tell pip to install just for our user. This
eliminates the need for <code>sudo</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pip

</code></pre><p>Before you install any Python package, always update three packages. <code>pip</code>,
<code>setuptools</code>, and <code>wheel</code>. These packages are used in the download and
installation process of many packages. Installation of packages may fail due to
them requiring features of these three packages only present in their latest
versions. Which is why we always update them before installing other packages.</p>

</code></pre><h2 id="installing-packages">Installing packages</h2>
<p>You should create a new &quot;virtual environment&quot; each time you have a new
python project. Typically for every directory with a <code>requirements.txt</code> in it,
you would also have a <code>.venv</code> directory in it with the virtual environment
which you installed the packages into.</p>
<p><a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment">https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment</a></p>
<h2 id="installing-packages-globally">Installing packages globally</h2>
<p>If you want packages to be available for use without activating a virtual
environment, you can install them to your user site-packages.</p>
<p>With a recent version of pip installed, Python will install to your <code>--user</code>
location even if you forget to specify. Or you can pass <code>--user</code> to be
explicit about it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade dffml
</code></pre><h2 id="async-def-and-await"><code>async def</code> and <code>await</code></h2>
<p><code>await</code> is a keyword which means &quot;give me the return value <em>when it's ready</em>&quot;.
The caller is understands the return value may not be ready right away. The
caller knows that the callee may not have the return value right away since the
callee function was defined with <code>async def</code>. Using the <code>await</code> keyword tells
Python that the caller wishes to pause execution (stay at the same line) and
wait for the callee's return value to be ready. Pausing of execution is usually
due to (but not limited to) network events, such as sending or receiving of
data, or the completion of work done within another thread or process.</p>
<p>The power of using <code>async def</code> (and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/asyncio-task.html"><code>asyncio</code></a> in general)
is that since the execution of a caller can be paused, multiple <code>async def</code>
functions can be run at the same time, an <code>async def</code> function is also known as
a coroutine. When a coroutine reaches the point where it would be waiting on an
event, such as completion of work in another thread or process, or a network
receive, etc. Python pauses the execution of that coroutine, and checks if there
is another coroutine that was waiting for an event which completed during the
running of the previous coroutine. If it finds a coroutine that was waiting for
a now complete event, it runs that coroutine until it either completes, or until
it is stuck waiting on another event.</p>

<code>$ </code> show the output which was a result of running a command. In the above
example. The output was <code>Hello World</code> (the same as the arguments, this is the
purpose of the <code>echo</code> command).</p>
<h2 id="command">Command</h2>

<p>To run a command. Type the command and it's arguments into your terminal /
shell. Then hit enter.</p>
<p>In the terminal, there is a general philosophy that no news means good news.
Many commands will only output text to the terminal if that is a part of their
core functionality. Otherwise commands usually output logging information or
error information.</p>
<h2 id="string">String</h2>
<p>The term <em>string</em> means a sequence of characters. Strings are usually found
or referred to within quotes. One can use the word string to talk about any
sequence of characters. Where <em>character</em> likely means something that can be
found in the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ascii.7.html">ASCII</a> table.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>UNIX</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="navigation-and-paths">Navigation and paths</h2>
<p>A directory is another word for a folder</p>
<p>When talking about where something is (a directory, a file, a command, etc.) we
use the word <em>path</em>.</p>
<p>The last part of a path is the something (the directory, the file, the command,
etc.)</p>
<p>Whenever we have a string that contains all the information we'd need to get
from where we are to wherever something is, we call it a path.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>.</code> means the directory you're in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>..</code> means the directory above the directory you're in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/</code> means the path <em>separator</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The file system works like a tree. We call something a <em>full path</em> or an
<em>absolute path</em> when it starts with <code>/</code>.</p>
<p>The directory a full path starts with is called the <em>root</em>. It's name is &quot;the
root directory&quot;, because we can't give it a name, since it's denoted via the
path separator. Whenever you see <code>/</code> as the only character in a path, or as the
first character of a path, think to yourself, that's the root directory.</p>
<p>Where <code>/</code> is not the first or only character, it's used to show separation
between files and directories.</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>/</code></p>
<ul>
<li>The root directory</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/a/b/c.txt</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Start at the root directory. Then go directory <code>a</code>. Within directory <code>a</code>
there is a directory <code>b</code>. Go into directory <code>b</code>. Within directory <code>b</code> there
is a file named <code>c.txt</code>. This is the file the path is referencing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>./a.out</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>.</code> means the current directory. The separator is seen after it. Then we see
<code>a.out</code> which is the file the path is referencing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>../updog</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Look in the directory above the one we're currently in for a file named
<code>updog</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>../../updog</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Look in the directory above the directory above the one we're currently in
for a file named <code>updog</code></li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2 id="useful-commands">Useful Commands</h2>
<p>Here are some commands that will be useful for you to understand where you are,
how to move around, and what stuff is in the directory (aka folder) you're in.</p>
<h3 id="where-am-i">Where am I?</h3>
<p>Use the <code>pwd</code> command to find out where you are on your system</p>
<p>In the below example, we run the <code>pwd</code> command and it tells us we're in our
<code>HOME</code> directory.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ pwd
/home/username
</code></pre><h3 id="what-files-are-here">What files are here?</h3>
<p>The <code>ls</code> command prints the contents of the directory we are currently in</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ ls
file1  file2
</code></pre><p>We can supply it with the name of a directory as an argument to have it list the
contents of that directory</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ ls my-directory
file1  file2
</code></pre><p>If we give <code>-lAF</code> as an argument to <code>ls</code> it will show us all the hidden files as
a long list.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ ls -lAF
total 0
-rw-rw-r--. 1 username username 0 Jul 30 18:00 file1
-rw-rw-r--. 1 username username 0 Jul 30 18:00 file2
</code></pre><h3 id="how-do-i-move-around">How do I move around?</h3>
<p>Pass the path as the only argument to the <code>cd</code> command to change where you
currently are, known as your <em>current working directory</em>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cd somewhere
</code></pre><p>Pass no arguments to be taken to your home directory</p>

<p>wget will save the file as it's filename</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ wget 'https://example.com/file.tar.gz'
</code></pre><p>curl usually needs to be told to follow redirects using <code>-L</code> and then to have it
save the file as the filename you'll need <code>-O</code> (which if you put it with the
<code>-L</code> you only need one <code>-</code>).</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ curl -LO 'https://example.com/file.tar.gz'
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>Sometimes one is installed on your system and the other isn't. Try the other
one if you're seeing something along the lines of &quot;Command not found&quot;</p>

<h3 id="extract-zip-and-tar-files">Extract zip and tar files?</h3>
<p>When you download software it usually in a <code>.tar</code> or <code>.zip</code> file.</p>
<p>You can extract <code>.tar</code> files using the tar command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ tar -xvf file.tar.gz

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey you know JavaScript, that thing everyone loves and hates.</p>
<p>Well chances are you've written some of it. And you don't understand what these
bullshit CORS messages are in the console when you try to make a request to a
service hosted on a different domain or port than the one your webpage is served
from.</p>
<p>CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature which makes it so
that websites can't send request to other websites without the permission of the
site the request is being sent to. Makes sense, but it can be a pain when
developing.</p>
<p>You need control over the web server you are <em>requesting</em> in order to make CORS
requests work (or a proxy between your client and the server).</p>
<h2 id="fetch">Fetch</h2>
<p>You might have run across this if you've tried using the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch">&quot;Using Fetch&quot;</a>
example from the Mozilla JavaScript documentation. Since it's about CORS.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="nx">fetch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">url</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</span><span class="c1"></span><span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="example-request">Example Request</h2>
<p>When your JavaScript makes a <code>POST</code> request to <code>/url/path/requested/by/client</code>,
the following is the interaction between the server and the client (for the
<em>preflight</em> request, in the successful case).</p>
<p>Since we've issued a <code>POST</code> request instead of a <code>GET</code> request, the browser is
going to make a request before the <code>POST</code> called the <em>preflight</em> request. This
request has a HTTP method of <code>OPTIONS</code>. The purpose is for the browser to check
if this JavaScript is allowed to make a <code>POST</code> request to the server.</p>
<pre><code>*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)

&lt; Server: Python/3.7 aiohttp/3.5.4
&lt; 
* Connection #0 to host 127.0.0.1 left intact
</code></pre><p>There's a couple important parts to this.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>OPTIONS</code>
<ul>
<li>Since the request is for the <code>OPTIONS</code> method. We need to make sure whatever
server we're using, or library we're using to make a webserver, will respond
to <code>OPTIONS</code> requests on the URL requested.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Access-Control-Request-Headers</code>
<ul>
<li>When the server responds to the <code>OPTIONS</code> request, it should include the
<code>Access-Control-Allow-Headers</code> header in the response. This tells the
browser what headers the JavaScript is allowed to send.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fixing-it">Fixing it</h2>
<p>You likely need to find some middleware for whatever framework your using, or
search for how to enable CORS with whatever your working with.</p>
<p>For example</p>

send it over to another system for use there.</p>

<p>Instead of doing a regular chroot use <code>systemd-nspawn</code> which gives you a more fully featured chroot.</p>

<h2 id="debugging-with-gdb">Debugging With GDB</h2>
<p>If you are lucky enough to be working on something that's in a VM you can get
GDB working!</p>
<p>You need to run the kernel without KASLR (on the cmdline that's <code>nokaslr</code>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don't disable KASLR gdb can't set breakpoints or display the source to you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then you run QEMU with <code>-s -S</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-s</code> says enable GDB on port <code>1234</code></li>
<li><code>-S</code> says wait to start the VM until GDB connects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Run GDB with <code>gdb ./vmlinux</code></p>
<p>Now run</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">(gdb) target remote 127.0.0.1:1234
</code></pre><p>To view the source code, type <code>layout src</code></p>
<p>To focus back on the typey type window, type <code>focus cmd</code></p>

seem to like comments very much. Instead they rely on people writing
insanely detailed commit messages describing what they are changing.</p>
<p>Every time you change the kernel you're changing something that has been
working fine for someone for X amount of long time. As such, you need to
be convincing for why your change should be accepted! Make your coverletter
and commit messages very detailed. The kernel is a big place. It may have
been a long time since someone reading your patch series has looked at the
place you're working. Be courtious and remind them of all the moving pieces
involved in what you're doing, and why and how you're changing them.</p>
<h3 id="etiquette">Etiquette</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can say <code>patch</code> or <code>patchset</code> in your coverletter. Just not in the
commit messages themselves.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="kvm-1">KVM</h2>
<h3 id="vmx">VMX</h3>
<p>When a VM enters VMX root mode (aka &quot;I'm gonna run some VMs mode&quot;) using
the <code>VMXON</code> instruction, it sets up what's called a <code>VMCS</code> for each VM
/ virtualized processor it wants to run. All VMX related instructions
operate on whatever VMCS we pointed to via the <code>VMPTRLD</code> instruction.</p>
<h3 id="nested">Nested</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>L0 == The host</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>L1 == The guest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>L2 == The guest of the guest</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>vmx/nested.c</code> is responsible for emulating VMX for L1. When L1 does a
<code>VMLAUNCH</code> or <code>VMRESUME</code>, <code>enter_guest_mode</code> is called, which means that
<code>is_guest_mode</code> will now return <code>true</code>.</p>
<h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>
<p>Root mode = L0 when not running a virtual machine</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wireguard is a VPN that comes built into Linux kernels &gt;= 5.6
It also has clients for OSs like Windows, OSX, and Android.</p>
<p>If you're looking for how to have a virtual LAN party, Wireguard
is a great way to do it. Since it's cross platform. You can even
play Windows games on Linux using Lutris and network them with
Wireguard to get Windows and Linux machines playing together.</p>
<h2 id="checking-if-you-have-it">Checking If You Have It</h2>
<p>To check if you're Linux distro already has wireguard support,
look in the modules directory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My version at the moment is <code>5.6.4-152.current</code>, yours will
likely be different</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ find /lib/modules/$(uname -r) -type f -name '*wireguard*.ko*'
/lib/modules/5.6.4-152.current/kernel/drivers/net/wireguard/wireguard.ko
</code></pre><p>If that doesn't show anything then check if it's built into the
kernel. This command will show some output if it is. On my system
it's a <code>.ko</code>, therefore it's not builtin, therefore this command
showed nothing.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ grep wireguard /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.builtin
</code></pre><p>You'll also need the <code>wg</code> command line utility. Just type <code>wg</code> and
if you see command not found then you'll want to head over to
<a href="https://www.wireguard.com/install/">https://www.wireguard.com/install/</a> for details on how to install it.</p>
<h2 id="getting-it">Getting It</h2>
<p>If you don't have a version of the Linux kernel with wireguard
built in, you can compile and use the
<a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-go/about/">wireguard-go</a> project.
It won't be as fast as compiling the kernel module but it might be
a hell of a lot less steps.</p>
<p>If you don't want to take the performance hit, you can compile the
kernel module as seen in the
<a href="https://www.wireguard.com/compilation/">compilation</a> instructions.</p>
<p>You'll build it, then add it to the kernel with <code>insmod</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ sudo insmod wireguard-linux-compat/src/wireguard.ko
</code></pre><p>Check <code>dmesg</code>, if you see complaints about missing symbols,
you can recompile those modules that are missing, as seen
under kernel requirements. You'll want to find out how your
Linux distribution recommends compiling the kernel. This is
because many of them have patches that your system won't
work without added to the kernel. You might be able to run
the kernel from kernel.org, but don't count on that.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-it">Configuring It</h2>
<p>The following is an example config file one might use.
There are comments within it to explain everything.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini"><span class="c1"># The Interface section is for defining things about this</span>
<span class="c1"># machine</span>

<span class="c1"># The config files of the other machines in the network</span>
<span class="c1"># will need the public key that correseponds to this private</span>
<span class="c1"># key. On Windows it will show you the public key in a little</span>
<span class="c1"># box under the config file name when it&#39;s being edited. On</span>
<span class="c1"># Linux, you can run the following command to parse this file</span>
<span class="c1"># to get the private key and convert it into the public key</span>
<span class="c1"># $ grep &#39;PrivateKey = &#39; wg.conf | tail -n 1 | sed -e &#39;s/.* = //g&#39; | wg pubkey</span>
<span class="na">PrivateKey</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">REPLACE_WITH_PRIVATE_KEY</span>

<span class="c1"># script that follows parses it out of this config file</span>
<span class="c1"># and uses it as your address. For Linux the wg tool will</span>
<span class="c1"># tell you there&#39;s an error if you uncomment it.</span>
<span class="c1"># You&#39;ll want to make sure you leave this as /24 and</span>
<span class="c1"># the other addresses as /32. See the References section</span>

</code></pre></div><p>If we wanted to setup a network where all machines would have
192.168.4.XXX addresses, we could do it as follows.</p>
<p>First, copy the example config file into a file named <code>wg.conf</code>.</p>
<p>You'll want to generate a new private key and add it to the file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ sed -i &quot;s#REPLACE_WITH_PRIVATE_KEY#$(wg genkey)#&quot; wg.conf
</code></pre><p>You need to get your public key from your private key.
The following command parses the private key out of the
config file and generates the corresponding public key.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ grep 'PrivateKey = ' wg.conf | tail -n 1 | sed -e 's/.* = //g' | wg pubkey
rR7O5IvIq16RpntAqZCNmTd42nsI6Mq5139XMYwZ5hQ=
</code></pre><p>The output of this command is the public key which will
be used in one of the <code>[Peer]</code> sections in the config of
the other machines in your new wireguard network. It will
change whenever you regenerate the private key and replace
it in the config file.</p>
<p>You should communicate with the other people you're trying
to set up your new wireguard network with to make sure you
all choose a different IP address for the line that has
<code>Address = </code>. On Windows you'll need to uncomment that line.
In the <a href="#using-it">Using It</a> section there will be a <code>setup.sh</code>
script, On Linux the script will parse the comment and use it
as your IP address within the wireguard network, do not
uncomment that line on Linux.</p>
<p>You can parse your config file to get your chosen address
using the following command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cat &quot;${conf}&quot;| grep 'Address = ' | sed -e 's/.* = //g' -e 's/\/24//g'
192.168.4.4
</code></pre><p>In this case, our machine will appear in the config file
of the other machines as follows</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini"><span class="k">[Peer]</span>

</code></pre></div><p>If you have the <code>ListenPort</code> exposed to the public internet,
via port forwarding or via firewall rules (or both). Then the

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="choosing-the-right-download">Choosing the right download</h2>
<p>So you went to download a file and you were presented with a list of options
similar to the following</p>
<p><img src="/images/binary-downloads.png" alt="list-of-binary-downloads"></p>
<p>You know you're on Linux. But which one of these Linux downloads is right for
you?</p>
<p>Run the <code>uname</code> tool to help you find out</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ uname -a
x86_64
</code></pre><ul>
<li><code>m</code> means tell us the hardware type</li>
</ul>
<p>If you see <code>x86_64</code> that means you want the download that says <code>amd64</code>.</p>
<h2 id="installing-it">Installing it</h2>
<p>When you're presented with a tarball (<code>.tar.*</code>) you'll want to download it and
untar it using either your browser, <code>wget</code>, <code>curl</code> or whatever you want.</p>
<p>Be careful when you extract the tarball! People usually leave all the files in
the top level directory and when you extract it all the sudden you'll have files
all over the place!</p>
<p>I recommend creating a <em>temporary</em> directory first and changing your directory
into it. We can do this all at once with the following command</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="k">$(</span>mktemp -d<span class="k">)</span>
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li>
<p><code>cd</code> is change directory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>mktemp</code> is a utility for creating temporary files and directories.
It will output the name, which we capture and use as the place we want to
change our current working directory to using the <code>$(  )</code> operator.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-d</code> tells it to make a directory</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of downloading Hugo which is shown in the screenshot above.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">curl -LO https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.74.3/hugo_0.74.3_Linux-64bit.tar.gz
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li>
<p><code>L</code> means follow any redirects, you'll usually want this, especially with
GitHub since it likes to redirect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>O</code> means save the file with the same name as it has in the URL</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We then extract the downloaded file</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">tar -xvz hugo_0.74.3_Linux-64bit.tar.gz
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li>
<p><code>x</code> means extract</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>v</code> means be verbose, print all extracted files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>z</code> means the file will be <code>.gz</code> compressed, and we'll need to decompress it
using the gzip decompression algorithm. If you run into other file types,
do a search to figure out what to replace this with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We should have extracted 3 files.</p>
<p>You now want to put the binary, the command line program you want to run, in one
of the directories in the <code>PATH</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>You can run</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$PATH</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To get a <code>:</code> separated list of directories you can move the <code>hugo</code> file to so
that you'll be able to use it from anywhere.</p>
<p>We'll move it into the <code>/usr/bin</code> directory, a common place for executable files
to live.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mv hugo /usr/bin/
</code></pre></div><p>Now you can return to where you we're before you created the temporary directory
by running</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">cd</span> -
</code></pre></div><p>We can now run hugo!</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ hugo version
Hugo Static Site Generator v0.74.3-DA0437B4 linux/amd64 BuildDate: 2020-07-23T16:22:34Z

</code></pre><pre><code>How to use an external command in Vim to modify the selection

Something I've found useful in other editors is the ability to:

take the selected text
run an external command and pass the selection to its stdin
take the external commands stdout and replace the current selection with it.
This way you can write useful text tools which operate on the selection using any language that can do basic io.

How can this be done with vim?

(Directly in the command line, or via a key binding?)

---

:'&lt;,'&gt;!command

'&lt;,'&gt; represents the (linewise) visual selection and is automatically inserted when you hit : and have something selected.

Example:

<p>Rudy (can't fail): Please edit the value of ForegroundFlashCount from the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop registry to the value of 1, then the icon will flash once. Which can reduce the number of icon flashing. Note: Setting to 0 will make the icon continuously flash. If you still need to stop Teams' icon flash, for this Windows OS related question, we will move this thread back to the original category. Meanwhile, if you don't want to use Teams client, actually, you can let it run in background via selecting the &quot;Open application in background&quot; options in Settings &gt; General.</p>

<h2 id="dotfiles">dotfiles</h2>
<p>Dotfiles is a term for configuration files. The name comes from their usually
being prefixed with a <code>.</code>. This is because on UNIX operating systems, files
prefixed with a <code>.</code> are <em>hidden</em>.</p>
<p>Here are mine: <a href="http://github.com/johnandersen777/dotfiles">http://github.com/johnandersen777/dotfiles</a></p>
<h2 id="linux-distros">Linux distros</h2>
<p>These days I stick mostly to the big three desktop distros, debian, ubuntu, and
fedora. I used to run Solus on my personal, it's out of commission at the moment
and I am waiting until Serpent OS releases <code>.iso</code> images to bring it back up
again.</p>
<p>I started using Fedora when I was doing the CR0/4 KVM work. Kristen and Rick told
me that Fedora guarantees that you'll be able to run the
<a href="./linux-kernel/#terminology">upstream kernel</a>. Unless you want to mess with
building <code>.deb</code> files on ubuntu so that you have all their configs and patches,
which sounds not fun to me, it's probably best to stick to a well supported distro
that you can just do a clean build of the linux tree and run the kernel on. But
I've been busy trying to get CI ironed out for that project so I haven't gotten
back to running on fedora in a while.</p>

<p>I forced myself to get used to a primarily terminal based development
environment because I constantly find myself on systems where I have either only
ssh or serial access.</p>
<p>Let me give you some scenarios where this might happen to you (and therefore its
nice to already be used to a terminal based workflow).</p>
<ul>
<li>You run Linux, your desktop crashed or froze
<ul>
<li>Press Ctrl-Alt-[F1 through F12] and you'll be presented with a terminal!</li>
<li>You're on a deadline (because when else would your desktop crash or freeze)
or your not sure what will happen / you will loose if you reboot the
machine.</li>
<li>No worries! Just <code>tmux attach</code> and you're right back where you were! Commit
your work, push it and reboot without worry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The production server broke
<ul>
<li>You're probably only going to have <code>ssh</code> access to this thing. You going to
want to read the logs and be able to poke around the file system with your
editor of choice (mine is <code>vim</code>) and restart stuff to see what's wrong.
(Chances are the server won't have <code>tmux</code>, but it might have
<a href="https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/"><code>screen</code></a> which is
similar so you'll be familiar with the concept).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You started a VM from the command line using QEMU (likely with
<code>-nographic -append &quot;console=ttyS0&quot;</code>) so you have a terminal into the guest
Linux machine but it's not a full ssh session, you're likely limited to 80
columns here. You'll be glad you stuck to 80 columns now that's all you can
see without whacky &quot;scrolling&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alt-tab">Alt-Tab</h3>
<p>The top reason why I do everything in the terminal though is Alt-Tab.</p>
<p>If you keep all your chat, email, open code repos in tabs within <code>tmux</code> then
open one browser window for all the docs, web based chats, etc. The beauty of
this is you only ever have two windows open. Which means whenever you hit
Alt-Tab you never have to guess where your going to end up! This is going to
save you insane amounts of time in the long run. Ditch the clutter. Hakuna
Matata.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>TAKE NOTES. NOTES ARE A SUPERPOWER. WHAT IS NOT WRITTEN DOWN IS LOST.
WHAT IS NOT ORGANIZED IS LOST. THOSE WHO WANDER ARE LOST WITHOUT NOTES!</p>

    <title>Clear Containers on Arch Linux</title>

    <published>2017-01-18T05:06:04Z</published>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So you want the security of a virtual machine but the ease of use of docker and
containers? Well Clear Containers is the solution for you my friend. Here I am
going to show you how to install and configure the Clear Containers runtime on
your Arch Linux host.</p>
<p>I have created to packages in AUR to assist you in building the packages you
need.</p>
<h3 id="qemu-lite-package">qemu-lite package</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/01org/qemu-lite">qemu-lite</a> provides virtualisation for Clear Containers. It's a fork of qemu
that has a new machine type, pc-lite. Which is a traditional x86_64 machine
with a lot of things striped out. This lets them turn off a lot of things in
the Linux kernel config and thus increases the speed at which the VM (Container
in this case) is run. This also decreases time it takes the virtualised
container to start up.</p>
<p>Lets build qemu-lite, which will replace the hosts qemu package. We just need
to clone the package from the AUR, build it with makepkg, and install it with
pacman.</p>
<p>pacman will complain about qemu-arch-extra and qemu-launcher needing the
regular qemu so if you have those installed you need to remove them. They will
not work with qemu-lite.</p>
<pre><code># Download the one I built for you
wget https://github.com/johnandersen777/johnandersen777.github.io/releases/download/CCARCH/qemu-lite-2.7.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
# Or build it yourself!
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/qemu-lite.git
cd qemu-lite
makepkg -cs
# Then install
sudo pacman -U qemu-lite-2.7.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
</code></pre><h3 id="cc-oci-runtime-package">cc-oci-runtime package</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/01org/cc-oci-runtime">Clear Containers runtime</a> is an alternative to runc. You can have some
containers running runc and some running cor (Clear Containers runtime), or all
one or the other. It provides the management of qemu-lite so you can use these
VMs as if they were containers. Basically its where the magic happens.</p>
<pre><code># Download the one I built for you
wget https://github.com/johnandersen777/johnandersen777.github.io/releases/download/CCARCH/cc-oci-runtime-2.1.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
# Or build it yourself!
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/cc-oci-runtime.git
cd qemu-lite
makepkg -cs
# Then install
sudo pacman -U cc-oci-runtime-2.1.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
</code></pre><h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
<p>Now we need to change how the docker daemon is run so that it knows about the
runtime he have just installed.</p>]]></content>

<li>Pick a much smaller current for R1 and R2, Ir (bias resistor current)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Ir = 200 uA
</code></pre><ul>
<li>Find R1 and R2 such that the voltage drop across R2 is the same as Vtn. This
is so that any input signal at all will act to turn on the transistor. Then
make R1 drop the rest of Vdd.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>R2 = Vtn / Ir
R2 = 1.6 / 200 uA
R2 = 8 k Ohms

R2 = (Vdd - Vtn) / Ir
R2 = (9 - 1.6) / 200 uA
R2 = 7.4 / 200 uA
R2 = 37 k Ohms
</code></pre><ul>
<li>Plug in reasonable values for the rest</li>
</ul>
<p>Cin and Cout should both be much much (two orders of magnitude) less than their
respective resistors.</p>
<pre><code>Rin = 1 k Ohms
Cin = 470 nF
Cout = 470 nF
Rout = 100k

    <title>ARM workflow with qemu and arm-none-eabi</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is just the markdown portion of set of files which can be found here:
<a href="https://gist.github.com/johnandersen777/3de9a9bdd38cacf3ea394207762f1002">https://gist.github.com/johnandersen777/3de9a9bdd38cacf3ea394207762f1002</a></p>
<p>This should get you up and running writing ARM assembly without hardware.</p>
<p>Clone this the repo for this tutorial.</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://gist.github.com/johnandersen777/3de9a9bdd38cacf3ea394207762f1002 arm-qemu
</code></pre><h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
<p>The first step is to install the necessary packages. These are the
arm-none-eabi tool chain and qemu with arm support.</p>
<h4 id="arch-linux">Arch Linux</h4>
<pre><code>sudo pacman -S arm-none-eabi-gcc arm-none-eabi-binutils arm-none-eabi-gdb \
  arm-none-eabi-newlib qemu qemu-arch-extra
</code></pre><h4 id="ubuntu">Ubuntu</h4>
<pre><code>sudo apt -y install make qemu-system-arm \
    gcc-arm-none-eabi binutils-arm-none-eabi gdb-arm-none-eabi \
    libstdc++-arm-none-eabi-newlib libnewlib-arm-none-eabi
</code></pre><h2 id="gdb">GDB</h2>
<p>In <code>.gdbinit</code> we have placed commands which gdb will run on startup. But to
make this work the <code>.gdbinit</code> file in our home directory needs to say its ok
for gdb to load this <code>.gdbinit</code> file. To do that we just add the directory to
the auto-load safe-path.</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;set auto-load safe-path $PWD&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.gdbinit
</code></pre><h2 id="building">Building</h2>
<p>The Makefile should have plenty of comments to help you understand what is
being done in it. It takes all the <code>.s</code> assembly files in the current directory
and compiles them into object files. Then it runs the linker to create the ELF
binary. All of this is done with arm-none-eabi-gcc rather than your regular
gcc for host programs.</p>
<pre><code>make
</code></pre><p>Will rebuild all the modified <code>.s</code> files into their object file forms and
relink to the binary. Run <code>make clean all</code> if you are having really weird
errors. That usually fixes things.</p>
<h2 id="running">Running</h2>
<p>To run you can do <code>qemu-arm ./main</code>. But hey why not put it in the Makefile
right.</p>
<pre><code>make all qemu
</code></pre><p>Will rebuild any changed files and run the created binary in qemu.</p>
<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>
<p>Oh you ran the program and everything exploded? Time to debug.</p>
<pre><code>make all gdb
</code></pre><p>Will rebuild all your source files and start the program in qemu with it as a
gdb target on port 1234, so make sure nothing else is using that port or change
it in the <code>.gdbinit</code> file and <code>Makefile</code>.</p>
<h2 id="help-nothing-works">Help nothing works</h2>

can see the solution.</p>

basic idea of static linking and disabling of feature's you don't need is
still the same.</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/kernelslacker/trinity
cd trinity
./configure
</code></pre><h2 id="step-2---32-bit-and-static-compilation">Step 2 - 32 bit and static compilation</h2>
<p>Edit the make file and add <code>-m32</code> to any line containing <code>CFLAGS</code> and add
<code>-static</code> to any line containing <code>LDFLAGS</code>. Just one line not all of them that
say LD/CFLAGS. For example.</p>
<pre><code>CFLAGS += -Wall -Wextra -g -O2 -I. -Iinclude/ -Wimplicit -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -D_GNU_SOURCE -D__linux__

<p>I found that gcc 6.2.1 said that this is an error so it wouldn't let me

</blockquote>
<h2 id="step-4---edit-configh">Step 4 - Edit config.h</h2>
<p>Take out anything you don't need or can't compile from <code>config.h</code>. For instance
Android recommends building on Ubuntu 16.04 so we were on a Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS
machine which at the time of writing is Linux 4.4ish. So we couldn't compile
<code>fds/bpf.c</code> because the kernel headers didn't contain the right version of
<code>linux/bpf.h</code> (bpf_addr was missing some members).</p>
<p>The solution is to comment out <code>USE_BPF</code> from <code>config.h</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="cp">#define USE_BPF 1
</span></code></pre></div><p>After</p>

</span></code></pre></div><h2 id="step-5---verify">Step 5 - Verify</h2>
<p>Before we push to the device make sure it has a chance of working. This means
that it will be 32-bit statically linked. For the edits we just made to the

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So you want to fuzz network applications with peach eh? Well you've come to the
right place. This is a tutorial on how to get you fuzzing TCP applications,
without TLS/SSL enabled. If you want to fuzz UDP or an application which only
communicates via TLS/SSL then this is a great place for you to start, however it
will not answer all your questions. I will point you in the right direction at
the end of this post.</p>
<p>The first step in fuzzing is to understand the structure of the protocol. It
often helps to have an example of this structure. Therefore we will be
capturing the data of our target and simply playing it back. If you were to
spend more time, which you should, then you would make data models in peach
which contain specific fields rather than the blob we will be using.</p>
<p>The two most well known ways of getting network traffic are tcpdump and
wireshark. Peach can use input from a file for the data model and mutate it. We
are going to use a tiny tool I wrote to capture the conversations back and
forth rather than telling you to open tcpdump / wireshark and copy paste to a
file. If you would rather do that be my guest.</p>
<h2 id="enter-convo-capture">Enter convo-capture</h2>
<p>This saves the TCP conversation to files. Give it the port and host it needs to
be monitoring. This is especially useful for fuzzing with peach on TCP based
programs so that you don't have to go into wireshark to capture then copy paste
the data from each sequence of packets. This will take all packets and put them
in a file until the other endpoint sends data. Then it will increment the
number on the exchange and write the data to that exchanges file.</p>
<p>The binary has been built and included in the gist for your convenience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By no means do I condone putting binaries in git repos but I know not
everyone has the go toolchain. You need libpcap and libpthread to run it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Building will use sudo because it will <code>set_cap_raw</code> on convo-capture. If you
don't want to set this then you have to run convo-capture as root.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git clone https://gist.github.com/johnandersen777/e2d1df77e81f07254da192fe1bc568a0 convo-capture
<span class="nb">cd</span> !$
./build.sh
</code></pre></div><p>Now you can move it to bin if you want or run it prepended with ./ from the
directory you built it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo mv convo-capture /usr/bin/convo-capture
</code></pre></div><blockquote>
<p>Personally I like to put things in ~/.local/bin/ but do as you will</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are now ready to capture packets. Keep in mind that convo-capture will not
write over files that you have previously captured if they are in the directory
you are working in. Be sure to delete files from previous captures or change to
a new directory.</p>
<p>Let's try to capture HTTP traffic using curl and python3's http.server
(SimpleHTTPServer in python2). First we need to ssh to another computer and
start an HTTP server or we can start one on our local machine. If you start one
on your machine then everywhere you see example.com replace it with localhost
and add <code>-i lo</code> to convo-capture for capturing on the loopback interface.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="o">[</span>johnandersen777@johnandersen777 convo-capture<span class="o">]</span>$ ssh example.com
<span class="o">[</span>johnandersen777@example.com ~<span class="o">]</span>$ python3 -m http.server <span class="m">4444</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now that we have a HTTP server running lets start convo-capture.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c1"># For localhost add -i lo</span>
<span class="c1"># convo-capture -p 4444 -ip localhost -i lo -v</span>
<span class="o">[</span>johnandersen777@johnandersen777 convo-capture<span class="o">]</span>$ convo-capture -p <span class="m">4444</span> -ip example.com -v
Capturing TCP port <span class="m">4444</span> <span class="k">for</span> host example.com
</code></pre></div><p>Ok great we are now capturing all traffic going to example.com on port 4444 from
our computer and from example.com port 4444 back to our computer.
Now we just need to use curl to generate a request we can capture.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">curl -v http://example.com:4444/file
</code></pre></div><p>Request sent! Look back at the session running convo-capture, you should see
that the output you observed in curl has been captured (expect for the &lt; and &gt;
left of the headers, curl adds those).</p>
<pre><code class="language-log" data-lang="log">[johnandersen777@johnandersen777 convo-capture]$ convo-capture -p 4444 -ip example.com -v

Yo this is the file
</code></pre><p>Now you can ctrl-c to stop the capture. As you can see we captured the
conversation from our local machine to the remote host and the response the
remote host sent us. If you do an ls you will also see the files that were
created by this capture.</p>

Yo this is the file
</code></pre><p>As you can see it has assembled the packets into files based on the order they
were sent in. For me the second file, the servers reply, was two packets.
convo-capture saw the two packets in a row from the server to client and said
ok this is all part of one message I'm going to save it to a file as such. A
message is a continuous sequence of packets ended when the other side starts
sending a message. The more messages that are collected the more files you will
see after you kill convo-capture.</p>
<p>There was only one back and forth so they are both 0 in the sequence. If you
were to have ran curl twice with convo-capture running then you would see the
contents of 0 repeated in 1.</p>
<p>This is very useful for fuzzing with peach. Peach allows us to order our call
and response to the target program. For example say you want to fuzz something
like git. git is not a simple call and response. It has an exchange of call,
response, call, response for a clone. Let's walk through how you would use
convo-capture to fuzz the git protocol with peach.</p>
<h2 id="capturing-the-git-protocol">Capturing the git protocol</h2>
<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/7xd0u4u0vfv7n7s7gq4f0zdg2"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/7xd0u4u0vfv7n7s7gq4f0zdg2.png" alt="asciicast"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This video goes shows the how to capture the data involved in a git clone
over the git protocol. Use it as a reference if you are having trouble with
the steps below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's take a stroll on over to tmp so we don't create a bunch of useless files.
We'll make a directory there to play in.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mkdir /tmp/demo
<span class="nb">cd</span> /tmp/demo
</code></pre></div><p>Make a few directories so nothing writes over each other. Then well make a git
repo and populate it with some files.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mkdir clonedir capture
mkdir testrepo
<span class="nb">cd</span> testrepo
cat <span class="s">&lt;&lt; EOF &gt; README.md
</span><span class="s">This is a super cool test repo
</span><span class="s">EOF</span>
git init
git add -A
git commit -sam <span class="s1">&#39;Added README.md&#39;</span>
<span class="nb">cd</span> ..
<span class="c1"># You should now be back in /tmp/demo</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We have our testrepo, now lets create a bare copy of it to be served by <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-on-the-Server-Git-Daemon">git
daemon</a>. This requires that we make the <code>git-daemon-export-ok</code> file
as well. Then we will start the git server.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git clone --bare testrepo testrepo.git
touch testrepo.git/git-daemon-export-ok
git daemon --reuseaddr --base-path<span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$PWD</span> <span class="nv">$PWD</span>
<span class="c1"># PWD is faster than typing /tmp/demo</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Great! The git server is up! We can look up what port it is running on, but
if perhaps we were fuzzing something we didn't know we would have to find out.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c1"># Apparently netstat is deprecated, so let&#39;s use ss</span>
ss -ltnp <span class="p">|</span> grep git
</code></pre></div><p>Alright its port 9418. In another shell go to the capture directory and start
convo-capture.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">cd</span> /tmp/demo/capture
convo-capture -p <span class="m">9418</span> -i lo
</code></pre></div><p>Capture is running, git server is up, all that's left is to go to clonedir and
watch the magic happen.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">cd</span> /tmp/demo/clonedir
git clone git://localhost/testrepo.git
</code></pre></div><p>Now switch back to the shell running convo-capture and hit it will ctrl-c. You
should see four files in the capture directory. We are going to fuzz the git
client so right now we are interested in the files which go from port 9418 to
some other port.</p>
<h2 id="using-our-captured-data-to-fuzz-with-peach">Using our captured data to fuzz with peach</h2>
<p>You should usually test against the master branch or the latest version of
whatever you are fuzzing. You don't want to waste time finding something which
has already been fixed. This is why we are going to build git from source. Of
course you don't have to do this. But if you have never built something from
source it would be good practice.</p>
<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/82390"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/82390.png" alt="asciicast"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This video shows the peach process. You probably want to skip past the
part were we run make on git.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that we know what the git server is sending to the client we could either
fuzz the server or the client. The client is easy because it exits after
cloning were as the server stays up to serve requests.</p>
<p>We are going to compile git from source so we need to download its
