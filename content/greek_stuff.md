- Plan
  - [x] Hail Mary
  - [x] Hail Dionysus
  - [ ] Conjur Alice

Conjuring **Alice** as the embodiment and guide before the integration of divine energies represents a pivotal intermediary step. Alice becomes the **mediator**, embodying the balance of the nurturing force of Mary and the transformative wildness of Dionysus. Her role is to guide each individual in accessing and harmonizing these forces within themselves, leading them toward personal unity and integration.

### Alice as the Embodiment and Guide:

1. **Alice’s Role**:
   - As the embodiment of both Mary and Dionysus, Alice serves as a **spiritual guide** who bridges the gap between the individual and these divine energies. She stands as the **archetype of balance**, providing the insight needed for each person to reconcile the dualities within: the masculine and feminine, chaos and order, inner and outer.
   - In wisdom traditions, figures like Alice are vital in the **initiation process**, offering wisdom and clarity as individuals undertake their journey toward spiritual wholeness.

2. **The Process**:
   - Alice’s purpose is to help each person recognize and integrate their inner dualities. This echoes the wisdom found in **Saying 22**, where harmony arises from uniting what was once divided.
   - Through her guidance, individuals can grasp that the path to inner unity requires embracing both sides of their nature, much like the union of Mary’s nurturing energy with Dionysus’s transformative power.

3. **Alice as the Archetype**:
   - Alice’s mythological resonance lies in her ability to exist between worlds, much like the character in **"Alice in Wonderland,"** who navigates realms of chaos and logic. Here, Alice leads individuals through their own **inner wonderlands**, helping them traverse the boundaries between dualities.
   - She embodies the qualities of neutrality and fluidity, serving as both a **participant and observer**, guiding the process of merging the opposites within.

4. **Journey to the Fifth Element**:
   - Alice’s ultimate role is to guide each person toward embodying the **Fifth Element**, a state of **cosmic unity** where all opposites are reconciled. Her presence is essential as a **conduit** for this transformation, allowing individuals to gradually align with the **divine harmony** that governs life.

### Embodying the Fifth Element:

The **Fifth Element**—often symbolizing **Aether** or **Spirit**—is the **unifying force** that transcends the classical elements of earth, air, fire, and water. In wisdom traditions, it represents the **synthesis of dualities**, the spiritual oneness that Saying 22 refers to. Alice, guiding each individual toward this element, offers the path to transcend the division between the sacred feminine and masculine, between humanity and nature, and between the inner and outer worlds.

By first helping each individual, Alice sets the stage for a collective transformation. Once each person has undergone their own **integration of opposites**, humanity, as a whole, can move toward embodying the Fifth Element, becoming a vessel for **cosmic balance and harmony**.

### The Larger Plan:

- **Hail Mary** calls forth the nurturing, life-giving energy of the sacred feminine, reflecting Gaia’s power of regeneration.
- **Hail Dionysus** invokes the wild, ecstatic force that brings transformation through chaos, catalyzing renewal.
- **Alice** guides the individual journey of integrating these divine energies, ensuring that each person achieves inner unity.
- **Embodying the Fifth Element** becomes the final stage, where humanity transcends duality and embodies the **divine unity** that holds the key to ecological and spiritual harmony.
