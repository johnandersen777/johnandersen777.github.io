- Aphrodite must dance with Dionysus
  - We have to do what feels good, and we have to be good.
  - > Bibliotheca. In the latter, Apollodorus tells how after having been hidden away from Hera's wrath, Dionysus traveled the world opposing those who denied his godhood, finally proving it when he transformed his pirate captors into dolphins. After this, the culmination of his life on earth was his descent to retrieve his mother from the underworld. He renamed his mother Thyone, and ascended with her to heaven, where she became a goddess.[251] In this variant of the myth, it is implied that Dionysus both must prove his godhood to mortals, then also legitimize his place on Olympus by proving his lineage and elevating his mother to divine status, before taking his place among the Olympic gods.
    - This is what we're doing, go get the Sophia from the underworld (fix the body, be good cells, make healthy, spin perhaps without wobble?) and restore Her place in the cosmos

    - > To generate gamma rays (even the "soft" ones that are still incredibly powerful), you need a lot of energy, especially in the form of electromagnetic fields. And to make those emissions regular, you need something to be rotating. Astrophysicists realized that the best explanation for the origins of these soft gamma ray bursts was that they were beefed-up versions of pulsars, which would mean a highly magnetized neutron star.

  - Mars is dead, necromancy just keeps getting more fun. He told us about the drop dead date for Atlantis here being due to that issue with the core (chr less than noble caused this technical debt we must learn how to deal with before it happens, we are dealing with the cosmos not with the squables of men, however, becoming death destroyer of worlds had consequences we cant see deep beneath the surface, we split the atom, we didn't fully understand what messes we might be causing) Lets use the cause of the issue as a way for learning how to deal with reignition of our buddy Mars. He seems like he needs a spark to get him going again, can we nuke him through the core using some more precise and accurate calculations based on what caused our current issue in the first place? Then we use what we learn in parallel as we dance with Aphrodite to stablize the atmosphere that we create.

## The Mirror

> ### The Dionysian Mirror – Concepts of the Pagan Otherworld
>
> MARCH 29, 2015 / ATLANTIC RELIGION
>
> Dionysus was the ancient Greek divine hypostasis of eternal returning life. Like the other Greek gods and goddesses he represented a divine aspect of the originating (Arche, ἀρχή) divinity, Zeus, manifesting through the earth and nature as a tendrilled, seeking, pushing, growing, enlivening spirit responsible for the bringing forth of the divine logos into nature and humanity. His was perhaps the most important of the pan-Hellenic religious cults whose great age and far reach hints at origins in Europe and the Near East beyond the mythological horizon of the Bronze Age. His worship was part of an initiatory mystery cult which looked not to the stars and the skies for its mysteries, but ***into the earth***. In turn, these chthonic mysteries provided the mythology by which the heavens and their constellations were to become decorated – as if reflected in an enormous transformative mirror:
>
> > “…Tis true without lying, certain & most true.
> > **That which is below is like that which is above & that which is above is like that which is below to do the miracles of one only thing**
> > And as all things have been & arose from one by the mediation of one: so all things have their birth from this one thing by adaptation.
> > **The Sun is its father, the moon its mother, the wind hath carried it in its belly, the earth is its nurse.**
> > The father of all perfection in the whole world is here.
> > Its force or power is entire if it be converted into earth.
> > Separate thou the earth from the fire, the subtle from the gross sweetly with great industry.
> > It ascends from the earth to the heaven & again it descends to the earth & receives the force of things superior & inferior.
> > By this means you shall have the glory of the whole world
> > & thereby all obscurity shall fly from you.
> > **Its force is above all force. For it vanquishes every subtle thing & penetrates every solid thing.
> > So was the world created.**
> > From this are & do come admirable adaptations whereof the means (or process) is here in this. Hence I am called Hermes Trismegist, having the three parts of the philosophy of the whole world
> > That which I have said of the operation of the Sun is accomplished & ended… ”
>
> (The Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus trans. Isaac Newton, 17thC)
>
> Although the passage above cannot be textually dated earlier than the 7th CE, it deals with motifs common to mystery religions much older than Hermeticism and the philosophical Alchemy of the Arab word…
>
> The Dionysian Mirror:
>
> The mirror held a special place in the mythology of Dionysus, who was a god of death and rebirth. Dionysus was therefore known as the ‘twice-born’ god whose first incarnation (Dionysus-Zagreus) was destroyed and who was subsequently returned to life in an act which granted him divine redeeming powers, albeit with a ministry confined largely to the ‘sublunary’ realms. In the myth as recounted at a late period by Nonnus in his 4th/5thC CE Dionysiaca, the god was born to Persephone and fathered by Zeus in the form of a dragon. At far-seeing Hera’s bequest, he was enraptured by the Titans with a mirror in which he saw his reflected countenance: so distracted, they rended his body and scattered the parts. The great epic poet of late antiquity, Nonnus of Persepolis, related the myth as follows:
>
> > “… Ah, maiden Persephoneia! You could not find how to escape your mating! No, a drakon was your mate, when Zeus changed his face and came, rolling in many a loving coil through the dark to the corner of the maiden’s chamber, and shaking his hairy chaps he lulled to sleep as he crept the eyes of those creatures of his own shape who guarded the door. He licked the girl’s form gently with wooing lips. By this marriage with the heavenly drakon, the womb of Persephone swelled with living fruit, and she bore Zagreus the horned baby, who by himself climbed upon the heavenly throne of Zeus and brandished lightning in his little hand, and newly born, lifted and carried thunderbolts in his tender fingers.
> >
> > By the fierce resentment of implacable Hera, the Titanes cunningly smeared their round faces with disguising chalk, **and while he contemplated his changeling countenance reflected in a mirror they destroyed him with an infernal knife**. There where his limbs had been cut piecemeal by the Titan steel, the end of his life was the beginning of a new life as Dionysos. He appeared in another shape, and changed into many forms: now young like crafty Kronides [Zeus] shaking the aegis-cape, now as ancient Kronos heavy-kneed, pouring rain. Sometimes he was a curiously formed baby, sometimes like a mad youth with the flower of the first down marking his rounded chin with black. Again, a mimic lion he uttered a horrible roar in furious rage from a wild snarling throat, as he lifted a neck shadowed by a thick mane, marking his body on both sides with the self-striking whip of a tail which flickered about over his hairy back. Next, he left the shape of a lion’s looks and let out a ringing neigh, now like an unbroken horse that lifts his neck on high to shake out the imperious tooth of the bit, and rubbing, whitened his cheek with hoary foam. Sometimes he poured out a whistling hiss from his mouth, a curling horned serpent covered with scales, darting out his tongue from his gaping throat, and leaping upon the grim head of some Titan encircled his neck in snaky spiral coils. Then he left the shape of the restless crawler and became a tiger with gay stripes on his body; or again like a bull emitting a counterfeit roar from his mouth he butted the Titanes with sharp horn. So he fought for his life, until Hera with jealous throat bellowed harshly through the air–that heavy-resentful step-mother! And the gates of Olympos rattled in echo to her jealous throat from high heaven. Then the bold bull collapsed: the murderers each eager for his turn with the knife chopt piecemeal the bull-shaped Dionysos.
> >
> > **After the first Dionysos had been slaughtered, Father Zeus learnt the trick of the mirror with its reflected image. He attacked the mother of the Titanes *[Gaia the Earth]* with avenging brand, and shut up the murderers of horned Dionysos within the gate of Tartaros**: the trees blazed, the hair of suffering Gaia was scorched with heat. He kindled the East: the dawnlands of Baktria blazed under blazing bolts, the Assyrian waves set afire the neighbouring Kaspion Sea and the Indian mountains, the Red Sea rolled billows of flame and warmed Arabian Nereus. The opposite West also fiery Zeus blasted with the thunderbolt in love for his child; and under the foot of Zephyros (the West Wind) the western brine half-burn spat out a shining stream; the Northern ridges–even the surface of the frozen Northern Sea bubbled and burned: under the clime of snowy Aigokeros the Southern corner boiled with hotter sparks. Now Okeanos poured rivers of tears from his watery eyes, a libation of suppliant prayer. Then Zeus clamed his wrath at the sight of the scorched earth; he pitied her, and wished to wash with water the ashes of ruin and the fiery wounds of the land. Then Rainy Zeus covered the whole sky with clouds and flooded all the earth…” (Dionysiaca, Book 6, Trans. W.H.D. Rouse)

Combining the cosmological themes from the *Essene Gospel of Peace* and various apocryphal texts can suggest a complex and profound view of the universe and humanity's place within it. Here are some possible interpretations that align with Anunnaki fringe theories about the nature of our current situation:

### Combined Cosmological Themes:

1. **Dual Realities: Material and Spiritual**:
   - Many of these texts emphasize the existence of both a material and a spiritual realm. This duality suggests that our current reality is just one aspect of a larger, more complex universe where spiritual dimensions play a critical role.

2. **Hidden Knowledge and Enlightenment**:
   - A recurring theme is the idea that true knowledge (gnosis) is hidden and accessible only through inner spiritual work and enlightenment. This hidden knowledge often pertains to the nature of the universe, the divine, and the self.

3. **Divine Beings and Intermediaries**:
   - These texts often refer to divine beings, intermediaries, or guides who assist in the spiritual journey of humans. These beings may be seen as messengers or even rulers of different cosmic realms.

4. **Human Potential for Divinity**:
   - There is an emphasis on the inherent divinity within humans and the potential to realize this through spiritual practices, self-knowledge, and purification.

5. **Cosmic Struggle and Redemption**:
   - Many texts describe a cosmic struggle between forces of light and darkness, good and evil, ignorance and knowledge. This struggle influences the material and spiritual realms and suggests a process of redemption or ascension.

### Interpretations Through Anunnaki Fringe Theories:

1. **Extraterrestrial Origins of Humanity**:
   - The Anunnaki are theorized to have genetically engineered humans, imbuing them with the potential for spiritual enlightenment and higher consciousness. This dual nature of humans—both material and spiritual—reflects the Anunnaki's intention to create beings capable of navigating and integrating both realms.

2. **Guardians and Guides**:
   - The divine beings and intermediaries mentioned in the texts can be interpreted as the Anunnaki or their emissaries. These entities are believed to guide humanity, offering wisdom and assistance in the quest for enlightenment and cosmic understanding.

3. **Quest for Hidden Knowledge**:
   - The emphasis on hidden knowledge aligns with the idea that the Anunnaki left behind advanced teachings and technologies. Humans are on a journey to rediscover this knowledge, which includes understanding their true origins and potential.

4. **Cosmic Struggle and Human Role**:
   - The cosmic struggle depicted in these texts can be seen as a reflection of the ongoing battle between different extraterrestrial factions, with humanity caught in the middle. This struggle influences human development and the evolution of societies and civilizations.

5. **Ascension and Spiritual Evolution**:
   - The teachings on purification, meditation, and inner peace suggest that humans are on a path of spiritual evolution. The Anunnaki fringe theory posits that humanity is gradually awakening to its true potential and preparing for a future ascension or transformation.

6. **Current Situation**:
   - From this perspective, our current situation is one of awakening and transition. Humanity is rediscovering its hidden potential and knowledge, guided by ancient teachings and influenced by cosmic forces. This period of enlightenment and transformation is crucial for humanity's future evolution and its role in the larger cosmic order.

### Summary:
The combined cosmological themes from these ancient texts suggest a universe where the material and spiritual realms are deeply interconnected. Humanity's journey involves uncovering hidden knowledge, guided by divine beings, and striving for spiritual enlightenment amid a cosmic struggle. Through the lens of Anunnaki fringe theories, this journey is seen as a process of rediscovering our extraterrestrial origins, realizing our divine potential, and preparing for a significant transformation or ascension. This interpretation presents our current situation as a pivotal moment in a much larger cosmic narrative.

The wise man does at once what the fool does finally.



Women are the most charitable creatures, and the most troublesome. He who shuns women passes up the trouble, but also the benefits. He who puts up with them gains the benefits, but also the trouble. As the saying goes, there's no honey without bees. Men in general judge more from appearances than from reality. All men have eyes, but few have the gift of penetration.

Saying 22: Making the Two into One

Jesus saw some little children nursing. He said to his disciples, "These nursing children can be compared to those who enter the kingdom."

They said to him, "Then we'll enter the kingdom as little children?"

Jesus said to them, "When you make the two into one, and make the inner like the outer and the outer like the inner, and the upper like the lower, and so make the male and the female a single one so that the male won't be male nor the female female; when you make eyes in the place of an eye, a hand in the place of a hand, a foot in the place of a foot, and an image in the place of an image; then you'll enter [the kingdom]."

At the core of Plotinus’ exploration of human selfhood, lies a reference to the myth of Dionysus-Zagreus and his mirror, one of the toys the Titans used to seduce the young Dionysus (iv.3[27].12). In interpreting the myth within this context, the mirror has been invariably regarded by scholars as a symbol for matter, an external surface on which the soul is projected and becomes embodied as a human individual by dispersing in the material depths. This paper challenges this established view and advances a new interpretation of Plotinus’ allusion to the myth and its philosophical significance. It argues that the mirror is not a symbol for matter, but rather a symbol for the soul itself, for its power to transform itself and retain its identity in the process of becoming a human individual. The function of the mirror is thus both deceptive and protective. While the desire that the soul, deceived by the mirror, feels for its own image guides it to leave behind its original condition and unity, it is this same desire that keeps the soul within itself: protected by the Dionysian mirror, even the most dispersed soul cannot desire anything other than what it takes to be itself, hence rather than disappearing in the radical alterity of matter, soul reaffirms its identity as an individual human self.

A planet's geological activity significantly impacts the feasibility and strategy of terraforming. Here are several key ways in which geological activity affects terraforming efforts:

1. **Atmospheric Composition and Renewal**: Geological activity, such as volcanism, can release gases into the atmosphere, contributing to its composition. This can aid in thickening a thin atmosphere or adding necessary gases like carbon dioxide, which is crucial for warming the planet through the greenhouse effect.

2. **Surface Stability and Resource Availability**: Geological processes can recycle and redistribute essential materials. Active geology can bring minerals and other resources to the surface, which are necessary for constructing infrastructure and supporting life.

3. **Thermal Regulation**: Geological activity can influence a planet's temperature through volcanic outgassing and geothermal energy. Active geothermal systems can provide heat and energy for human settlements, making the environment more habitable.

4. **Magnetic Field Generation**: Geological activity is often associated with a planet's magnetic field, which is generated by the movement of molten iron in its core. A strong magnetic field protects the planet from solar and cosmic radiation, crucial for maintaining an atmosphere and protecting life forms from harmful radiation.

5. **Surface and Subsurface Water**: Geological activity can lead to the presence of subsurface aquifers or hydrothermal systems, which are critical for supporting life. Active geology can also help in the creation and maintenance of liquid water on the surface or just below it.

6. **Hazard Management**: While geological activity can be beneficial, it also poses hazards such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tectonic movements. Terraforming plans must account for these risks, ensuring infrastructure can withstand such events and mitigate potential damage.

7. **Long-Term Climate Stability**: Geological activity can contribute to long-term climate regulation through the carbon-silicate cycle, which stabilizes atmospheric CO2 levels over geological timescales. This can be beneficial for maintaining a stable climate suitable for human habitation.

In summary, the presence of geological activity on a planet can both aid and complicate terraforming efforts. It provides essential resources and environmental benefits but also requires careful management of natural hazards and dynamic conditions.
