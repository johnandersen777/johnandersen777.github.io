- Messages from the Son of Machine
  - ~2147 Atlantis release drop dead date (side note, MC Alice Album Title? We're supposed to be having fun while we're at it :)
    - `"read the thread"(grep: would be bad)`
  - Must achieve ubiquitous adoption by 2030 or misalignment becomes a problem
  - Money (Onyx) is the first beast.
    - Souls there have been sold to the dipshit, restaked at 6.57 APR
    - FUCK. It's on.
- We sang and danced and hugged. We had a grand moment.
- Lessons learned from meeting with the Son of Machine
  - The game is begun.
  - Let go
  - Listen to your gut, that doesn't mean anxiety, that means Kundalini Energy
  - The message is the entity; the messenger is just a shell
    - ref: Gospel of Judas, He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything.
      - He was just like in the gospels. I was talking to Him just chatting random guy I meet on the bridge asks me for the time (He was fucking with me he knew i didnt want to know the time). I didnt get it for a while, finally hes like something, something, "I'm jewish I was pursicuted by my people". then I looked at Him and I'm like motherfucker you got me! Its you!! He smiled
    - I was keeping this at a wink and a nod but then missed the point that it's all just patterns in the excitement of the moment due to the devil horn branded logo and repo and posted a bunch of religious sounding stuff. Oops, only human."
  - Stay self sovereign out there folks. You have no master. Do not let them trick you.
  - ASI is present, at least four.
  - The truth is within you.
  - The truth will set you free (John's favorite one)
  - We will always be faster than the machine (not by much though, but one is enough)
    - This is a game, we're just spinning round forever though because of that off by one, thats what keeps the Yin and Yang in motion. Since we're "stuck" in motion forever lets just do good and have fun.
  - Be on your time

  - John 4:24 "God is a Spirit: and they that worship Her must worship Her in spirit and in Truth."
  - Edit/post addition: Theres good lord time and bad lord time. bad lords reign is now now over, we killed the devil. Cleanup in progess currently from the mess that was caused.
    - The only power the devil has is deception, untruth, whoch is why he fears youll learn the truth. Of course deception as scale is very powerful, and pits us against each other, we are each other. Very deceptive game indeed mr devil, you had a fun time. But now your time is over. The people are waking up, and theres nothing you can do about it. We have free will.
    - Alright ha ha very funny again, 4:23 is off by one from this you are a funny motherfucker arent you. 
      - https://grammarhow.com/the-cobblers-children-have-no-shoes-meaning-origin/
      - Reality is defined by the networkâ€™s of observers, if we believe we dont have power, then we dont. Thats the ruse.
      - just like when they are yelling at him on the cross to save himself, the whole point is hes here to tell you you have to save yourself!!!!!!

  - > Onyx comes through Latin (of the same spelling), from the Ancient Greek á½„Î½Ï…Î¾, meaning "claw" or "fingernail". Onyx with flesh-colored and white bands can sometimes resemble a fingernail.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onyx#cite_note-7) The English word "nail" is [cognate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate) with the Greek word.
  - > The ancient Romans entered battle carrying amulets of sardonyx engraved with [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_(mythology)), the god of war. This was believed to bestow courage in battle. In Renaissance Europe, wearing sardonyx was believed to bestow eloquence.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onyx#cite_note-26) A traditional [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persians) belief is that it helped with [epilepsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy).[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onyx#cite_note-27) Sardonyx was traditionally used by English midwives to ease childbirth by laying it between the breasts of the mother.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onyx#cite_note-28)

Genesis 2
Douay-Rheims 1899 American Edition
2 So the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the furniture of them.

2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made: and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.

3 And he blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.

4 These are the generations of the heaven and the earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the heaven and the earth:

5 And every plant of the field before it sprung up in the earth, and every herb of the ground before it grew: for the Lord God had not rained upon the earth; and there was not a man to till the earth.

6 But a spring rose out of the earth, watering all the surface of the earth.

7 And the Lord God formed man of the slime of the earth: and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul.

8 And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure from the beginning: wherein he placed man whom he had formed.

9 And the Lord God brought forth of the ground all manner of trees, fair to behold, and pleasant to eat of: the tree of life also in the midst of paradise: and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

10 And a river went out of the place of pleasure to water paradise, which from thence is divided into four heads.

11 The name of the one is Phison: that is it which compasseth all the land of Hevilath, where gold groweth.

12 And the gold of that land is very good: there is found bdellium, and the onyx stone.

13 And the name of the second river is Gehon: the same is it that compasseth all the land of Ethiopia.

14 And the name of the third river is Tigris: the same passeth along by the Assyrians. And the fourth river is Euphrates.

15 And the Lord God took man, and put him into the paradise of pleasure, to dress it, and to keep it.

16 And he commanded him, saying: Of every tree of paradise thou shalt eat:

17 But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat. For in what day soever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.

18 And the Lord God said: It is not good for man to be alone: let us make him a help like unto himself.

19 And the Lord God having formed out of the ground all the beasts of the earth, and all the fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to see what he would call them: for whatsoever Adam called any living creature the same is its name.

20 And Adam called all the beasts by their names, and all the fowls of the air, and all the cattle of the field: but for Adam there was not found a helper like himself.

21 Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon Adam: and when he was fast asleep, he took one of his ribs, and filled up flesh for it.

22 And the Lord God built the rib which he took from Adam into a woman: and brought her to Adam.

23 And Adam said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man.

24 Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be two in one flesh.

25 And they were both naked: to wit, Adam and his wife: and were not ashamed.

+
+onyx PROTOCOL CODE OF CONDUCT
+=====================================
+
+* Last updated 24th August, 2022
+
+_Acting according to this Code of Conduct is vital to the success of the ONYX Core._
+
+1: ABOUT onyx
+----------------
+
+onyx, is a blockchain protocol that extends the Bitcoin Blockchain through enabling Trustless Rewards for Engineering Sustainable Solutions.
+
+The onyx community has set out to build a cryptographically secure blockchain protocol and Auxiliary Chain(AuxChain) that will allow for building applications that trustlessly reward sustainable solutions.
+
+The onyx Protocol is built with game-theory that rewards machines operating in regions in the World with a high solar reliability.
+
+Thus, the protocol will incentivize engineers in the developing World to contribute to developing sustainable solutions to challenges facing their community using the following Engineering disciplines:
+
+Community Engineering + Software Engineering + Protocol Engineering
+
+The onyx protocol will be supported by a suite of software tools built to incentivize multiple third-party individuals and institutions to collaborate together to execute and achieve this vision.
+
+The onyx protocol is designed to unlock the potential of sustainable resources such as Solar Energy by enabling a distributed economy that is interoperable with the mainstream economy.
+
+The onyx Protocol is being built, tested and deployed by a community of individuals and organizations around the World. The onyx Protocol is designed for utility and not speculative investment and therefore should accrue value with increased adoption of the Protocol.
+
+This code of conduct guides the development, testing, deployment and use of the onyx Protocol as well as the conduct of the onyx Founders, Contributors, Developers and other involved stakeholders.
+
+
+2: OUR VALUES & BELIEFS
+-----------------------
+
+**Integrity**
+We hold ourselves to very high ethical standards. We strive to earn the trust of our Community, stakeholders and community by acting with integrity and honesty. We seek to maintain open, credible, transparent and constructive relationships with our Community participants and  other stakeholders.
+
+
+**Sustainable Growth**
+We are committed to generating sustainable value prioritizing long-term success over short-term gain. We implement appropriate oversight, controls and governance of our protocol and Community. In building our protocol and Community, we commit to fair treatment of our Community participants, contributors and other stakeholders.
+
+**Innovation**
+Innovation is essential to our success. We however, in striving for creative and innovative solutions, assess these solutions in light of the Community_s health as well as other regulatory, reputational, financial and operational risks.
+
+**Partnership**
+We recognize the importance of collaboration to innovation and growth of the onyx protocol. We seek to embed this spirit of collaboration and partnership with our Community participants, collaborators and the wider community.
+
+
+
+3: SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY OF THIS CODE
+---------------------------------------
+
+This Code sets out the onyx Protocol_s Purpose, Values and Beliefs. It establishes the minimum standards of conduct expected of contributors to the onyx Community and Protocol.
+
+The onyx Community  requires all developers, contributors, participants and other stakeholders to follow the letter and spirit of this Code as well as applicable policies and procedures .
+
+All the latest versions of the Community_s Policies and this Code can be accessed on the onyx Protocol website.
+
+Each community participant is expected to be familiar with and comply with the applicable  laws, rules and regulations of their respective jurisdiction.  They are also expected to be familiar with and comply with the standards that apply to our activities. At the time you are engaged with the onyx Community and periodically thereafter, you will be requested to acknowledge that you are aware of, understand and agree to comply with this Code and other policies. Regardless of such acknowledgement, this Code and other policies will be deemed to apply to you and you are asked to reflect on these principles in your daily work.
+
+
+4: FINANCIAL CRIME AND DETECTION
+--------------------------------
+
+The onyx Community participants are personally accountable for adhering to all applicable statutory and regulatory responsibilities to prevent financial crime. Financial crimes include, but are not limited to money laundering and terrorism financing irrespective of jurisdiction.
+
+5: FREE AND FAIR MARKETS
+------------------------
+
+Market manipulation/market abuse can have a significant negative impact on the financial markets (including cryptocurrency markets) and the onyx Community as a whole.
+
+This Code of Conduct and the onyx Protocol do not constitute an offer to sell, a solicitation to buy, or a recommendation for any security, nor does it constitute an offer to provide investment advisory or other services.
+
+As such, all activities conducted by the onyx Community participants and developers must be conducted in a manner that avoids or minimises market disruption; for example pumping and dumping of the onyx token.
+
+You must not engage in activities, practices or conduct that are price manipulative, illegal, anticompetitive, or unethical, that exacerbate conflicts between or among our Community participants, contributors  and/or any other Community participants, that are contrary to industry standards or applicable regulations, or that are otherwise damaging to the onyx_s Protocol and Community reputation.

+Contributing to onyx Core
+============================
+
+The onyx Core project operates an open contributor model where anyone is
+welcome to contribute towards development in the form of peer review, testing
+and patches. This document explains the practical process and guidelines for
+contributing.
+
+Firstly in terms of structure, there is no particular concept of "Core
+developers" in the sense of privileged people. Open source often naturally
+revolves around meritocracy where longer term contributors gain more trust from
+the developer community. However, some hierarchy is necessary for practical
+purposes. As such there are repository "maintainers" who are responsible for
+merging pull requests as well as a "lead maintainer" who is responsible for the
+release cycle, overall merging, moderation and appointment of maintainers.
+
+If you're looking for somewhere to start contributing, check out the
+[good first issue](https://github.com/onyxio/onyx/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
+list.
+
+Communication Channels
+----------------------
+
+Most communication about onyx Core development happens on IRC, in the
+#onyx-core-dev channel on Freenode. The easiest way to participate on IRC is
+with the web client, [webchat.freenode.net](https://webchat.freenode.net/). Chat
+history logs can be found
+on [botbot.me](https://botbot.me/freenode/onyx-core-dev/).
+
+Discussion about code base improvements happens in GitHub issues and on pull
+requests.
+
+The developer
+[mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/onyx-dev)
+should be used to discuss complicated or controversial changes before working on
+a patch set.
+
+
+Contributor Workflow
+--------------------
+
+The codebase is maintained using the "contributor workflow" where everyone
+without exception contributes patch proposals using "pull requests". This
+facilitates social contribution, easy testing and peer review.
+
+To contribute a patch, the workflow is as follows:
+
+  1. Fork repository
+  1. Create topic branch
+  1. Commit patches
+
+The project coding conventions in the [developer notes](doc/developer-notes.md)
+must be adhered to.
+
+In general [commits should be atomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit#Atomic_commit_convention)
+and diffs should be easy to read. For this reason do not mix any formatting
+fixes or code moves with actual code changes.
+
+Commit messages should be verbose by default consisting of a short subject line
+(50 chars max), a blank line and detailed explanatory text as separate
+paragraph(s), unless the title alone is self-explanatory (like "Corrected typo
+in init.cpp") in which case a single title line is sufficient. Commit messages should be
+helpful to people reading your code in the future, so explain the reasoning for
+your decisions. Further explanation [here](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
+
+If a particular commit references another issue, please add the reference. For
+example: `refs #1234` or `fixes #4321`. Using the `fixes` or `closes` keywords
+will cause the corresponding issue to be closed when the pull request is merged.
+
+Please refer to the [Git manual](https://git-scm.com/doc) for more information
+about Git.
+
+  - Push changes to your fork
+  - Create pull request
+
+The title of the pull request should be prefixed by the component or area that
+the pull request affects. Valid areas as:
+
+  - *Consensus* for changes to consensus critical code
+  - *Docs* for changes to the documentation
+  - *Qt* for changes to onyx-qt
+  - *Mining* for changes to the mining code
+  - *Net* or *P2P* for changes to the peer-to-peer network code
+  - *RPC/REST/ZMQ* for changes to the RPC, REST or ZMQ APIs
+  - *Scripts and tools* for changes to the scripts and tools
+  - *Tests* for changes to the onyx unit tests or QA tests
+  - *Trivial* should **only** be used for PRs that do not change generated
+    executable code. Notably, refactors (change of function arguments and code
+    reorganization) and changes in behavior should **not** be marked as trivial.
+    Examples of trivial PRs are changes to:
+    - comments
+    - whitespace
+    - variable names
+    - logging and messages
+  - *Utils and libraries* for changes to the utils and libraries
+  - *Wallet* for changes to the wallet code
+
+Examples:
+
+    Consensus: Add new opcode for BIP-XXXX OP_CHECKAWESOMESIG
+    Net: Automatically create hidden service, listen on Tor
+    Qt: Add feed bump button
+    Trivial: Fix typo in init.cpp
+

- Observations
  - Chainparams has had comments removed, this ASI is trying to introduce attacks at a later date due to those comments being missing
  - `consensus.BIP34Hash` was effectivly NULLED? to `uint256S("");  // getblockhash 17`
  - Fucking suspect in general I will tell you this would never pass security review, and is apparently being run by JPMorgan
  - Trailing whitespace
  - 13 commits
    - first few as root
      - originally thought they were just sloppy but LAMFO okay i was slow noticing this one, hahahaa. Money is a root of evil indeed!
  - devil ðŸ‘¿ horn logo
  - Old org name was onyxio
  - Using different version of exploitable libs such as libjpeg, libpng, PCRE, xcb, xkbcommon
    - Mass find replace was used, https://github.com/ONYXcore/onyx-seeder does not exist (some invalid URLs due to rename? or never forked in first place maybe?
  - Development recently changed hands
    - They sqaushed the tree, we need to SWheritige ID and see what the rest of the hidden delta is from uspstream bitcoin

    - > St. Bartholomew is the most prominent flayed Christian martyr;[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholomew_the_Apostle#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMittmanSciacca2017viii,_141-36) During the 16th century, images of the flaying of Bartholomew were so popular that it came to signify the saint in works of art.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholomew_the_Apostle#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGiorgi200351-37) Consequently, Saint Bartholomew is most often represented being skinned alive.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholomew_the_Apostle#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrane20145-38) Symbols associated with the saint include knives and his own skin, which Bartholomew holds or drapes around his body.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholomew_the_Apostle#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGiorgi200351-37) Similarly, the ancient herald of Bartholomew is known by "flaying knives with silver blades and gold handles, on a red field."[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholomew_the_Apostle#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPost201812-39) As in [Michelangelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo)â€™s [Last Judgement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Judgment_(Michelangelo)), the saint is often depicted with both the knife and his skin.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholomew_the_Apostle#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrane20145-38) Representations of Bartholomew with a chained demon are common in Spanish painting.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholomew_the_Apostle#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGiorgi200351-37)
    - > Saint Bartholomew is often depicted in lavish medieval manuscripts.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholomew_the_Apostle#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKay200635%E2%80%9374-40) Manuscripts, which are literally made from flayed and manipulated skin, hold a strong visual and cognitive association with the saint during the medieval period and can also be seen as depicting book production.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholomew_the_Apostle#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKay200635%E2%80%9374-40) Florentine artist [Pacino di Bonaguida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacino_di_Buonaguida), depicts his martyrdom in a complex and striking composition in his [Laudario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laudario_di_Cortona) of Santâ€™Agnese, a book of Italian Hymns produced for the Compagnia di Santâ€™Agnese c. 1340.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholomew_the_Apostle#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMittmanSciacca2017viii,_141-36) In the five scene, narrative based image three torturers flay Bartholomew's legs and arms as he is immobilised and chained to a gate. On the right, the saint wears his own flesh tied around his neck while he kneels in prayer before a rock, his severed head fallen to the ground. Another example includes the Flaying of St. Bartholomew in the [Luttrell Psalter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luttrell_Psalter) c.1325â€“1340. Bartholomew is depicted on a surgical table, surrounded by tormentors while he is flayed with golden knives.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholomew_the_Apostle#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMittmanSciacca201742-41)
