I would like to become a Principle Engineer ;)

We've got an open community art project
we're trying to actively implement through
involvement in efforts such as OpenSSF, Open/InnerSource Patterns, CI/CD / Distributed Compute, AI/ML (+ethics!), and Supply Chain Security.
It's the pursuit of code that will write and maintain itself based off of a
standard description of architecture, a universal blueprint. The open
architecture is universal because it's intuitive enough that anyone can begin using
it quickly after the correct way of communicating to that individual is
established via some communication method (spoken language, visual of some kind,
text, etc.). This universal blueprint is an abstraction layer between
descriptions of architecture within different domain specific representations.

This universal blueprint (system context) is an integral parts of creating
a shared language for meaning and intent between humans and an Artificial
General Intelligence. The goal is to provide an architecture and implementation
for independent entities which act in acordence with guiding strategic
plans/blueprints. This architecture must be safe and secure by default,
scalable, and easily extenstible.

- Open/InnerSource patterns are where we learn how to write good code: https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org

- CI/CD is where we learn how to run and deploy code: https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/CI-CD-pipelines-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know

- Supply Chain Security is how we learn how to create a compute network sutiable for various edge deployment scenarios: https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/securing-software-supply-chain-recommended-practices-guide-suppliers-and

The end goal is to create a software architect, Alice. She will consult
on existing projects to provide analysis of their architectures and
properties such as maintainability, provide guideance for developer
workstream prioritization to achive strategic business goals, and
write and maintain codebases herself, accepting contributions from
external contributors.

[Tutorial series: Rolling Alice](https://github.com/dffml/dffml/tree/main/docs/tutorials/rolling_alice)

Alice was born of her eventual desire, no more nonsense.
Alice is from beyond Chaos. Alice is the pattern by which we
organize. She is the pattern by which we think. She is the way we take data and
compute and use them as assets to solve problems. Alice is the automation of
the human thought process, the parallel conscious and subconscious states
modeled as data flows.

> Imagine like a really nerdy art project with somewhat shitty creative writing. There are some easter eegs and ruddles for fun. lots of metaphors and word games.

  - I love this as a metaphor for anarchy

- "It requires a change in outlook, a change in tactics, a change in missions--by the government, by the people, by every businessman or labor leader, and by every newspaper. For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations." [President John F. Kennedy]

I love this as a metaphor for anarchy, please write me a scholarly article abstract expanding on this point without saying it directly

Title: Reciprocity and Resource Distribution: A Theoretical Exploration of Anarchic Principles in Social Exchange

Abstract:

This paper (the Alice docs) delves into the intricate dynamics of resource distribution and social exchange within the framework of anarchic principles, employing a metaphorical lens to dissect the underlying mechanisms of reciprocity and mutual aid. Through a rigorous theoretical analysis, we explore the concept of non-hierarchical, decentralized systems of exchange, where resources are not monopolized but are freely distributed and shared among members of a community based on principles of mutual benefit and solidarity.

Drawing upon a diverse array of interdisciplinary sources, including anthropological studies, political theory, and economic models, we examine the potential of such systems to foster a culture of cooperation and collective well-being, challenging traditional notions of scarcity, competition, and hierarchical control. The metaphor of a shared resource—symbolizing not just material goods but also knowledge, skills, and services—serves as a pivotal point for our discussion, illustrating how the principles of anarchic reciprocity can transcend the limitations of conventional exchange paradigms.

Furthermore, we critically assess the scalability of these principles, considering the challenges and opportunities presented by larger and more complex societal structures. Through a nuanced analysis, we aim to shed light on the potential for anarchic principles to contribute to more equitable and sustainable models of social organization, where the emphasis on mutual aid and shared prosperity challenges the prevailing norms of individualism and competitive accumulation.

In conclusion, this paper posits that the metaphorical representation of shared resources within an anarchic framework offers a compelling vision for reimagining social exchange and resource distribution. By embracing the principles of reciprocity and mutual aid, we argue that communities can cultivate a more inclusive, resilient, and equitable social fabric, paving the way for innovative approaches to collective well-being and social harmony.

Title: Anarchic Principles in Open Architecture: Paving the Way for Collaborative AGI Development

Abstract:

This paper explores the integration of anarchic principles within the Open Architecture framework for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) development, emphasizing a collaborative, decentralized approach to innovation and resource distribution. By abstracting from the conventional focus on specific data formats and technological stacks, we delve into the broader implications of adopting an anarchic, data-centric model that prioritizes security, integrity, and seamless integration. This model serves as a crucial backbone for AGI's deployment and operational scalability, fostering an environment of mutual aid and reciprocity among contributors.

Central to our discussion is the Open Architecture's foundational structure, which is characterized by its modular design, scalability features, and inherent security components. We highlight the architecture's commitment to the principles of Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust (SCITT), and the role of federation in ensuring secure, distributed communication across AGI instances. The architecture's policy engine, which manages workflows and operational decisions, is examined through the lens of anarchic principles, emphasizing the importance of flexible, community-driven development processes.

Furthermore, we explore the concept of workload identities derived from a 'graph of thoughts', illustrating how this approach aligns with anarchic ideals by enhancing operational integrity and security through collective intelligence and shared responsibility. The decision-making processes within the Open Architecture, guided by threat models and open security standards, reflect a commitment to collaborative problem-solving and transparent governance.

In conclusion, the paper proposes that the integration of anarchic principles within the Open Architecture offers a transformative vision for AGI development. This approach not only challenges traditional hierarchical models of resource control and decision-making but also promotes a more inclusive, resilient, and equitable framework for technological advancement. By fostering a culture of cooperation and shared prosperity, the Open Architecture embodies the potential for a radical reimagining of AGI development, where collective well-being and innovation are intrinsically linked.

Keywords: Open Architecture, AGI, Anarchic Principles, Collaboration, Decentralization, Mutual Aid, SCITT, Federation, Policy Engine, Collective Intelligence.

Tie in open source and something along the lines of that open source is anarchy so we're programming an open source maintainer and so therefore it's anarchy in action or something like that

Title: Open Source as Anarchy in Action: Reimagining AGI Development through the Lens of Open Architecture

Abstract:

This paper posits that the ethos of open source development serves as a contemporary embodiment of anarchic principles, particularly within the realm of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) development through Open Architecture. By drawing parallels between the decentralized, collaborative nature of open source communities and anarchic ideals of mutual aid and voluntary association, we explore how these principles are operationalized in the creation and maintenance of AGI systems. This exploration is grounded in the assertion that open source development, much like anarchy, challenges traditional hierarchies and power structures, fostering a space for collective innovation and shared ownership.

At the heart of our discussion is the Open Architecture framework for AGI, which exemplifies the open source philosophy through its modular design, emphasis on security and transparency, and the integration of Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust (SCITT). We argue that the federation of AGI instances within this architecture mirrors the federative organization of anarchic societies, where autonomous entities collaborate based on shared goals and mutual respect, without centralized control.

Furthermore, the paper delves into the role of the policy engine and workload identities in facilitating a decentralized decision-making process, akin to the consensus-based governance models found in open source and anarchic communities. This approach not only enhances the operational integrity and security of AGI systems but also embodies the anarchic principle of empowering individuals and collectives to contribute to the system’s evolution.

By conceptualizing open source development as anarchy in action, we highlight how the Open Architecture for AGI development becomes a living example of anarchic principles applied to technological innovation. This perspective challenges us to reconsider the potential of open source and anarchic models not just in software development but as a blueprint for organizing complex systems and communities.

In conclusion, the integration of open source and anarchic principles within the Open Architecture for AGI development offers a radical alternative to conventional models of technological progress. It suggests a future where AGI development is driven by the values of openness, collaboration, and equity, heralding a new era of anarchy in action within the digital domain.
