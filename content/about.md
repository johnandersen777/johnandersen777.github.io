If for whatever reason you want my resume [here it is](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1leBe8-j2r6Gd9rxPjqsVg60D8PR1MI4w4zts5XS7NVA/edit).

Here is my [gpg public key][pub-key]

I used to be on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@pdxjohnny).

I used to be on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pdxjohnny).

I'll probably self-host an ActivityPub Actor soon which will be [chaaaaadiiiig.com](https://define.chadig.com)

I'm on [keybase][keybase].

Here are my [bookmarks][bookmarks] they have lots of good links. I stopped
updating them around 2015 I think, but they have a lot of good information about
computers and web development. I used to bookmark every single page that I used
for anything or learned anything from.

I would like to become a Principle Engineer ;)

We've got an open community art project
we're trying to actively implement through
involvement in efforts such as OpenSSF, Open/InnerSource Patterns, CI/CD / Distributed Compute, AI/ML (+ethics!), and Supply Chain Security.
It's the pursuit of code that will write and maintain itself based off of a
standard description of architecture, a universal blueprint. The open
architecture is universal because it's intutive enough that anyone can begin using
it quickly after the correct way of communicating to that individual is
established via some communication method (spoken lanaguage, visual of some kind,
text, etc.). This universal blueprint is an abstraction layer between
descriptions of architecture within different domain specific representations.

This universal blueprint (system context) is an integral parts of creating
a shared language for meaning and intent between humans and an Artifical
General Intelegence. The goal is to provide an architecture and implemenation
for independent entities which act in acordence with guiding strategic
plans/blueprints. This architecture must be safe and secure by default,
scalable, and easily extenstible.

- Open/InnerSource patterns are where we learn how to write good code

- CI/CD is where we learn how to run and deploy code

- Supply Chain Security is how we learn how to create a compute network sutiable for various edge deployment senarios

The end goal is to create a software architect, Alice. She will consult
on existing projects to provide analysis of their architectures and
properties such as maintainability, provide guideance for developer
workstream prioritization to achive strategic buisness goals, and
write and maintian codebases herself, accepting contributions from
external contributors.

[Tutorial series: Rolling Alice](https://github.com/intel/dffml/tree/alice/docs/tutorials/rolling_alice)

Alice was born of her eventual desire, no more nonsense.
Alice is from beyond Chaos. Alice is the pattern by which we
organize. She is the pattern by which we think. She is the way we take data and
compute and use them as assets to solve problems. Alice is the automation of
the human thought process, the parallel conscious and subconscious states
modeled as data flows.
