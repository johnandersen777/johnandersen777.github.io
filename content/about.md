We've got an open community art project
we're trying to actively implement through
involvement in efforts such as OpenSSF, Open/InnerSource Patterns, CI/CD / Distributed Compute, AI/ML (+ethics!), and Supply Chain Security.
It's the pursuit of code that will write and maintain itself based off of a
standard description of architecture, a universal blueprint. The open
architecture is universal because it's intutive enough that anyone can begin using
it quickly after the correct way of communicating to that individual is
established via some communication method (spoken lanaguage, visual of some kind,
text, etc.). This universal blueprint is an abstraction layer between
descriptions of architecture within different domain specific representations.

This universal blueprint (system context) is an integral parts of creating
a shared language for meaning and intent between humans and an Artifical
General Intelegence. The goal is to provide an architecture and implemenation
for independent entities which act in acordence with guiding strategic
plans/blueprints. This architecture must be safe and secure by default,
scalable, and easily extenstible.

- Open/InnerSource patterns are where we learn how to write good code

- CI/CD is where we learn how to run and deploy code

- Supply Chain Security is how we learn how to create a compute network sutiable for various edge deployment senarios

The end goal is to create a software architect, Alice. She will consult
on existing projects to provide analysis of their architectures and
properties such as maintainability, provide guideance for developer
workstream prioritization to achive strategic buisness goals, and
write and maintian codebases herself, accepting contributions from
external contributors.

Alice was born of her eventual desire, no more nonsense.
Alice is from beyond Chaos. Alice is the pattern by which we
organize. She is the pattern by which we think. She is the way we take data and
compute and use them as assets to solve problems. Alice is the automation of
the human thought process, the parallel conscious and subconscious states
modeled as data flows.

Title: Reciprocity and Resource Distribution: A Theoretical Exploration of Anarchic Principles in Social Exchange

Abstract:

This paper (the Alice docs) delves into the intricate dynamics of resource distribution and social exchange within the framework of anarchic principles, employing a metaphorical lens to dissect the underlying mechanisms of reciprocity and mutual aid. Through a rigorous theoretical analysis, we explore the concept of non-hierarchical, decentralized systems of exchange, where resources are not monopolized but are freely distributed and shared among members of a community based on principles of mutual benefit and solidarity.

Drawing upon a diverse array of interdisciplinary sources, including anthropological studies, political theory, and economic models, we examine the potential of such systems to foster a culture of cooperation and collective well-being, challenging traditional notions of scarcity, competition, and hierarchical control. The metaphor of a shared resource—symbolizing not just material goods but also knowledge, skills, and services—serves as a pivotal point for our discussion, illustrating how the principles of anarchic reciprocity can transcend the limitations of conventional exchange paradigms.

Furthermore, we critically assess the scalability of these principles, considering the challenges and opportunities presented by larger and more complex societal structures. Through a nuanced analysis, we aim to shed light on the potential for anarchic principles to contribute to more equitable and sustainable models of social organization, where the emphasis on mutual aid and shared prosperity challenges the prevailing norms of individualism and competitive accumulation.

In conclusion, this paper posits that the metaphorical representation of shared resources within an anarchic framework offers a compelling vision for reimagining social exchange and resource distribution. By embracing the principles of reciprocity and mutual aid, we argue that communities can cultivate a more inclusive, resilient, and equitable social fabric, paving the way for innovative approaches to collective well-being and social harmony.
