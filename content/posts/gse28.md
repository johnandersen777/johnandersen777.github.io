## Applying Support Levels and Contribution Policies to Bob's Extra Fish Example

In our journey towards creating equitable and sustainable communities, we've explored concepts from software development—such as support levels, contribution guidelines, and working group policies—and applied them to community management. In this article, we will map these software concepts to the example of **Bob** sharing his extra fish, focusing on the **input side of the supply chain**. By doing so, we aim to demonstrate how structured frameworks can enhance resource distribution and collaboration within communities.

### Revisiting Bob's Extra Fish Scenario

**Bob** is an avid fisher who often catches more fish than he needs. He wishes to share his surplus with the community. Previously, we discussed how Bob communicates with fellow fishers and community members to distribute his extra catch. Now, we'll apply software development concepts to this scenario to improve the efficiency and fairness of the supply chain.

## Mapping Software Concepts to the Supply Chain

### Support Levels in Resource Contribution

In software, support levels help manage plugins and contributions based on their importance and maintenance requirements. We can apply similar levels to resources contributed to the community supply chain.

#### Defining Support Levels for Contributions:

- **Level 0 (Essential Resources)**:
  - Critical contributions that are fundamental to the community's well-being.
  - Example: Basic food staples required to meet the community's nutritional needs.

- **Level 1 (High-Priority Resources)**:
  - Important contributions that significantly enhance the community's quality of life.
  - Example: Bob's regular surplus fish, which provide valuable protein.

- **Level 2 (Supplementary Resources)**:
  - Contributions that add variety or convenience but are not essential.
  - Example: Occasional specialty catches or gourmet items.

- **Level 3 (Optional Resources)**:
  - Non-essential contributions that may be experimental or limited in scope.
  - Example: New types of seafood that the community is not accustomed to.

### Party Levels in Community Participation

Party levels categorize contributors based on their relationship and commitment to the community supply chain.

- **1st Party (Core Contributors)**:
  - Individuals like Bob, who consistently contribute significant resources.
  - Have a strong commitment to the community's needs.

- **2nd Party (Regular Contributors)**:
  - Community members who contribute resources regularly but to a lesser extent.
  - Examples: Other fishers who occasionally have surplus.

- **3rd Party (Occasional Contributors)**:
  - External individuals or groups who contribute infrequently.
  - Examples: Visiting fishers or donors from neighboring communities.

## Applying Contribution Guidelines and Policies

### Establishing Community Standards for Contributions

To ensure fairness and efficiency in resource distribution, the community can adopt guidelines similar to software contribution policies.

#### Contribution Guidelines Based on Support Levels:

- **Level 0 Contributions**:
  - Must meet strict quality and safety standards.
  - Require regularity to ensure a stable supply.
  - Example: Bob ensures his fish are fresh, properly stored, and delivered on schedule.

- **Level 1 Contributions**:
  - Should adhere to quality guidelines but with some flexibility.
  - Encourage consistency but allow for occasional variability.

- **Level 2 Contributions**:
  - Recommended to follow best practices but not strictly enforced.
  - Provide diversity to the supply chain.

- **Level 3 Contributions**:
  - Accepted with minimal requirements.
  - May serve as opportunities to introduce new resources.

### Working Group Policies

Just as software projects have working groups or guilds, the community can form groups to manage different aspects of the supply chain.

#### Examples of Working Groups:

- **Quality Assurance Group**:
  - Ensures that all contributions meet the established standards.
  - Applies stricter oversight to Level 0 and Level 1 contributions.

- **Logistics Group**:
  - Manages the collection, storage, and distribution of resources.
  - Coordinates with contributors to optimize the supply chain.

- **Outreach Group**:
  - Engages with 3rd party contributors.
  - Encourages broader participation and educates on contribution guidelines.

## Alice's Role in the Supply Chain

### Acting as the Community Coordinator

**Alice**, our AI assistant, can facilitate the smooth operation of the supply chain by:

- **Managing Communications**:
  - Keeps contributors informed about community needs and guidelines.
  - Sends reminders to contributors about delivery schedules and standards.

- **Monitoring Contributions**:
  - Tracks the quantity and quality of resources being contributed.
  - Categorizes contributions based on support levels and party levels.

- **Assisting Working Groups**:
  - Provides data and insights to help working groups make informed decisions.
  - Automates routine tasks, such as scheduling and reporting.

### Practical Example: Bob's Contribution Process

1. **Planning**:
   - Bob informs Alice about his expected surplus.
   - Alice categorizes Bob's contribution as a Level 1 resource from a 1st party contributor.

2. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Bob follows the guidelines provided by Alice to ensure his fish meet community standards.
   - Alice schedules a quality check with the Quality Assurance Group.

3. **Logistics Coordination**:
   - Alice coordinates with the Logistics Group to arrange pick-up and distribution.
   - Ensures timely delivery to community members.

4. **Feedback and Improvement**:
   - Community members provide feedback on the resources received.
   - Alice compiles feedback and shares it with Bob and relevant working groups.
