## Enabling Community Participation in the Fish Supply Chain

In our previous article, we laid out the technical foundations for a transparent and decentralized supply chain using GitHub Actions, KERI, and ActivityPub. Now, we'll explore how this system facilitates tracking work and enables anyone to contribute to the **Loaves and Fishes** initiative. We'll illustrate this by telling the story of **Alice** teaching **Bob** to fish, demonstrating how the fish part of the supply chain operates. **Eve** will be our example customer benefiting from this collaborative effort.

### Introducing the Characters

- **Alice**: An experienced fisher and community member familiar with the Loaves and Fishes supply chain system.
- **Bob**: A newcomer interested in contributing by fishing.
- **Eve**: A community member who receives the fish through the Loaves and Fishes distribution network.

### Alice Teaches Bob to Fish: A Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Onboarding Bob into the System

**Alice** meets **Bob** at a community event and learns about his interest in fishing. She explains how he can contribute to the supply chain.

- **Creating an Account**: Bob sets up his identity using the KERI protocol, generating his unique CUID (self-certifying identifier).
- **Accessing the Repository**: Alice shows Bob the GitHub repository where fishing activities are coordinated.
- **Understanding the Workflow**: Alice walks Bob through the GitHub Actions workflows that outline the fishing processes.

#### Step 2: Planning the Fishing Trip

Bob needs to plan his fishing activities and log them into the system.

- **Scheduling**: Bob checks the **"Fishing Schedule"** in the repository to find suitable times and locations.
- **Equipment Check**: He verifies the equipment list and ensures he has everything needed.
- **Environmental Compliance**: Bob reviews guidelines to ensure sustainable and legal fishing practices.

#### Step 3: Logging Work to Be Done

Bob uses the system to log his planned activities.

- **Creating an Issue**: In the GitHub repository, Bob creates a new issue titled **"Fishing Trip on September 20th"**.
- **Detailing the Plan**: He fills in details such as location, target species, estimated catch, and expected return time.
- **Assigning the Task**: Bob assigns the issue to himself, indicating he will undertake this work.

#### Step 4: Approval and Community Engagement

Alice reviews Bob's plan to ensure everything is in order.

- **Peer Review**: Alice and other experienced fishers review Bob's issue, offering suggestions or approvals.
- **Automated Checks**: GitHub Actions run automated workflows to check for compliance with regulations and community guidelines.
- **Approval**: Once approved, the issue moves to the **"Scheduled Activities"** column in the project board.

#### Step 5: Executing the Fishing Activity

On the day of the trip, Bob proceeds with his plan.

- **Real-Time Updates**: Bob uses a mobile app connected to the system to log real-time updates.
- **KERI Event Logging**: Each significant action (departure, arrival at fishing spot, start of fishing) is signed with his private key, creating immutable records.
- **Safety Checks**: The system monitors Bob's location (with his consent) for safety purposes.

#### Step 6: Recording the Catch

After fishing, Bob logs the results.

- **Catch Details**: Bob updates the issue with the types and quantities of fish caught.
- **Photographic Evidence**: He uploads photos as proof of catch and for quality assessment.
- **Sustainability Metrics**: Bob records bycatch and any environmental observations.

#### Step 7: Distribution Preparation

Bob prepares the fish for distribution.

- **Processing**: If required, Bob cleans and processes the fish according to guidelines.
- **Packaging**: He packages the fish using standardized materials.
- **Labeling**: Each package is labeled with QR codes linked to the KERI events, providing traceability.

#### Step 8: Updating the Supply Chain

Bob updates the system to reflect the availability of the fish.

- **Inventory Update**: He creates a new entry in the **"Available Fish"** database, detailing the quantity and type.
- **ActivityPub Broadcast**: The system automatically broadcasts the availability to subscribers, including distribution centers and community kitchens.
- **Assigning Distribution**: Bob coordinates with logistics volunteers to arrange pickup or delivery.

### Eve Receives the Fish

**Eve** is a community member who benefits from the Loaves and Fishes initiative.

#### Step 1: Subscribing to Updates

- **Account Setup**: Eve creates an account and subscribes to notifications about available food.
- **Preferences**: She indicates her dietary preferences and needs.

#### Step 2: Receiving Notification

- **Alert**: Eve receives a notification that fresh fish is available, caught by Bob.
- **Details**: She can view information about the fish, including when and where it was caught, ensuring transparency.

#### Step 3: Placing an Order

- **Requesting Fish**: Eve places a request through the system for a portion of the available fish.
- **Confirmation**: The system confirms her request and provides pickup or delivery details.

#### Step 4: Receiving the Fish

- **Distribution Center**: Eve goes to the designated community center to receive the fish.
- **Verification**: She scans the QR code to access the provenance information, confirming the fish's journey from Bob to her.
- **Feedback**: Eve has the option to provide feedback on the quality and her experience.

### Enhancing the Fish Supply Chain with Existing Provenance Projects

We can integrate existing fish provenance projects to strengthen our system.

#### Leveraging Provenance Technologies

- **Blockchain Integration**: Use blockchain solutions that specialize in tracking seafood supply chains.
- **IoT Devices**: Implement sensors and trackers to monitor temperature and handling conditions.
- **Compliance Data**: Incorporate certifications and regulatory compliance data into the provenance records.

#### Benefits

- **Food Safety**: Ensures that the fish is safe for consumption through monitored handling.
- **Environmental Responsibility**: Verifies that fishing practices meet sustainability standards.
- **Consumer Trust**: Builds confidence among consumers like Eve through transparency.

### Encouraging Community Participation

Anyone can contribute to the supply chain by following Bob's example.

#### Open Access

- **Inclusive Platform**: The system is open to all community members interested in fishing or other activities.
- **Resource Availability**: Provides access to guidelines, training materials, and support.

#### Skill Development

- **Workshops**: Offer training sessions led by experienced members like Alice.
- **Mentorship**: Establish mentorship programs to guide newcomers.

#### Recognition

- **Acknowledgment**: Contributors receive recognition for their efforts, fostering a sense of accomplishment.
- **Reputation System**: Build a reputation system within the KERI framework to highlight reliable contributors.

### Tracking Work to Be Done

The system efficiently manages tasks and opportunities for participation.

#### Task Boards

- **Project Management**: Use GitHub project boards to list tasks needing attention, such as fishing trips, logistics, or equipment maintenance.
- **Task Assignment**: Community members can assign tasks to themselves based on interest and availability.

#### Notifications

- **Automated Alerts**: The system sends notifications about new tasks, upcoming events, or urgent needs.
- **Customizable Preferences**: Users can set preferences to receive relevant information.

#### Progress Tracking

- **Real-Time Updates**: Monitor the status of tasks and projects.
- **Completion Metrics**: Track the completion rates and impact of various activities.

### Ensuring Sustainability and Compliance

- **Protected Areas**: Identify areas where fishing is restricted to protect ecosystems.

#### Regulatory Compliance

- **Licensing Requirements**: Inform contributors about necessary fishing licenses and help facilitate the process.
- **Catch Limits**: Enforce adherence to legal catch limits through system checks.

#### Data Reporting

- **Environmental Data**: Collect data on fish populations and environmental conditions to support conservation efforts.
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Generate reports required by authorities automatically.

### The Role of Technology in Community Empowerment

Our technical system is a tool that empowers individuals and strengthens the community.

#### Accessibility
