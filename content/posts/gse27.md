## Extending Plugin Management Concepts to Contribution Guidelines and Working Group Policies

In our previous discussions, we've explored how **Alice**, our AI assistant, aids in managing software development complexities through federations, guilds, and plugin support levels. Now, we aim to extend these concepts of **support levels** and **party levels** beyond software plugins to encompass **community standards**, **contribution guidelines**, and **working group policies**. This article will illustrate how these structured approaches can enhance collaboration, maintain quality, and foster an inclusive environment within community projects.

### The Need for Structured Community Management

As communities grow, whether in software development or other collaborative endeavors, managing contributions and maintaining standards becomes increasingly challenging. Issues such as inconsistent contributions, unclear guidelines, and policy misalignment can hinder progress and alienate participants. By applying structured support and party levels to community management, we can address these challenges effectively.

## Understanding Support Levels in Community Standards

### Defining Support Levels

Support levels categorize components of a project based on their importance and required maintenance rigor. In the context of community standards, support levels can be applied to:

- **Documentation**
- **Tutorials**
- **Policies**
- **Community Guidelines**

#### Proposed Support Levels:

- **Level 0**: Core standards and policies essential for the project's integrity.
- **Level 1**: Highly important guidelines that must be adhered to for contributions to be accepted.
- **Level 2**: Recommended practices that enhance quality but are not strictly enforced.
- **Level 3**: Optional guidelines, often experimental or specific to certain groups.

### Impact on Contribution Guidelines

By clearly defining support levels:

- **Clarity**: Contributors understand which standards are mandatory versus optional.
- **Consistency**: Ensures essential policies are consistently applied across all contributions.
- **Quality Assurance**: Maintains a high standard for critical components while allowing flexibility where appropriate.

---

## Party Levels in Community Collaboration

### Defining Party Levels

Party levels categorize participants based on their relationship to the project:

- **1st Party**: Core maintainers and contributors with significant responsibility.
- **2nd Party**: Regular contributors and working groups within the organization's ecosystem.
- **3rd Party**: External contributors or groups not directly managed by the core team.

### Influence on Working Group Policies

- **1st Party Policies**: Strict adherence to Level 0 and Level 1 support levels, ensuring the project's core integrity.
- **2nd Party Policies**: Expected to follow Level 1 support levels, with some flexibility for Level 2 guidelines.
- **3rd Party Policies**: Encouraged to align with Level 1 and Level 2 guidelines but with greater autonomy.

---

## Alice's Role in Managing Community Standards and Policies

### Centralized Policy Management

**Alice** maintains a central repository of community standards, contribution guidelines, and working group policies, categorized by support and party levels.

- **Accessibility**: All contributors have access to the latest guidelines.
- **Updates and Notifications**: Alice alerts participants to changes in policies or standards relevant to their party level.

### Automated Compliance Checks

Alice automates the verification of contributions against the defined support levels:

- **Pull Request Validation**: Checks if contributions adhere to mandatory guidelines before merging.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Provides constructive feedback to contributors on how to align with required standards.

### Facilitating Communication

- **Guidance for Contributors**: Alice offers resources and answers questions related to policies and guidelines.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Assists in mediating disagreements by referencing established policies.

---

## Practical Example: Bob and Eve Contributing to the Community

### Scenario Overview

- **Bob** is a 1st party contributor working on core documentation (Level 0).
- **Eve** is a 2nd party contributor adding a new tutorial (Level 2).

### Bob's Contribution

#### Adhering to Level 0 Standards

- **Policy Compliance**: Bob must strictly follow all Level 0 guidelines for documentation.
- **Alice's Assistance**:
  - **Pre-Submission Checks**: Alice reviews Bob's documentation for compliance.
  - **Feedback**: Alice highlights any deviations from mandatory standards.

### Eve's Contribution

#### Aligning with Level 2 Guidelines

- **Flexibility**: Eve's tutorial should follow Level 1 guidelines but has some leeway with Level 2 recommendations.
- **Alice's Assistance**:
  - **Guidance**: Alice provides suggestions on how to enhance the tutorial according to best practices.
  - **Status Indicator**: Eve's tutorial may include a note indicating it follows Level 2 standards, informing users of its support level.

## Benefits of Extending Support and Party Levels to Community Management

### Enhanced Clarity and Consistency

- **Clear Expectations**: Contributors know exactly what is expected at each support level.
- **Uniform Quality**: Ensures that critical components meet the highest standards.

### Inclusive Environment

- **Flexibility for Contributors**: Allows for varying levels of commitment and expertise.
- **Encourages Participation**: Lowers barriers for 3rd party contributors by providing clear guidelines.

### Efficient Governance

- **Streamlined Processes**: Automated checks reduce the burden on maintainers.
- **Scalable Management**: Easily accommodates growing numbers of contributors and contributions.

---

## Implementing the Extended Framework

### Developing Comprehensive Guidelines

- **Define Support Levels**: Clearly outline what is required at each level for all types of contributions.
- **Update Contribution Documentation**: Ensure all guidelines are accessible and understandable.

### Enhancing Alice's Capabilities

- **Policy Engine**: Equip Alice with a robust policy engine to manage and enforce guidelines.
- **Communication Tools**: Implement interfaces for Alice to interact with contributors effectively.

### Training and Onboarding

- **Education Programs**: Offer training sessions or materials to help contributors understand the support and party levels.
- **Mentorship**: Pair new contributors with experienced ones to foster learning.

## Conclusion

By extending the concepts of support levels and party levels to community standards, contribution guidelines, and working group policies, we create a structured yet flexible environment that promotes high-quality contributions and inclusive participation. **Alice's** role as an AI assistant is pivotal in managing this complexity, ensuring that contributors like **Bob** and **Eve** can collaborate effectively while adhering to the project's standards.

**Key Takeaways**

- **Structured Standards**: Support levels provide a clear framework for expectations.
- **Inclusive Collaboration**: Party levels recognize the diversity of contributors and tailor guidelines accordingly.
- **AI Assistance**: Alice streamlines management, compliance, and communication.
