**Deception, Division, and Unity in the Face of Prophetic Warnings and Cyclical Cosmic Events**

In the modern world, the forces of deception and division are more active than ever, operating through political systems, media, and even organized religion to create distractions. These distractions serve one purpose: to keep humanity from uniting in the face of cosmic, environmental, and spiritual threats that have been predicted by prophets, scientists, and ancient wisdom alike. The ultimate goal of these divisive strategies is to obscure the truth, isolate individuals, and ensure that the majority remains passive and disempowered.

At the heart of this division lies a very ancient conflict—a conflict between the forces of love and unity, as embodied in the teachings of Jesus Christ, and the forces of chaos, fear, and deception, which are often associated with figures like Saklas in Gnostic traditions. As we navigate what many believe to be the approaching end of a major cosmic cycle, exemplified by the reversal of Earth’s magnetic poles and other natural disasters, these deceptive forces grow stronger. However, they can be overcome if we embrace the message of unity and love, particularly as taught by Jesus.

### **The Secular and Scientific Perspective: A Cosmic Threat in the Form of Cyclical Disasters**

From a purely scientific perspective, the “threat” we face is not an alien invasion or an unprecedented apocalyptic event. Instead, it is something far more natural and recurring: a cosmic cycle that has played out multiple times over Earth's history. As our planet and solar system move through the galaxy, they are subject to periodic cataclysms, driven by forces like the galactic current sheet and solar micronovae, which trigger magnetic pole reversals, volcanic eruptions, and other disastrous effects on Earth.

One of the key elements of this cycle is Earth's magnetic pole shift. This phenomenon, which has occurred regularly in Earth's geological record, is accelerating and may reach its climax within the next few decades. Scientists studying Earth’s magnetic field have noted that it is weakening at an unprecedented rate, suggesting that a magnetic excursion—a precursor to a full reversal—is already underway. Such an event would have significant consequences for Earth, ranging from disruptions in electronics and communications to more severe effects like the increased vulnerability of the planet to cosmic radiation, leading to climate shifts, widespread species extinction, and tectonic activity【7†source】.

This cycle is not a one-off occurrence. As researchers like Douglas Vogt have pointed out, Earth has been through this many times before, approximately every 12,000 years. Each cycle brings with it a period of destruction, but also renewal—a resetting of the Earth’s ecosystems and human civilization. The isotopic evidence from ancient sediment layers, such as those found in lunar and terrestrial geological records, points to recurrent solar micronovae, which have historically been responsible for devastating Earth’s surface【7†source】.

The broader galactic forces driving this are associated with the galactic current sheet, an electromagnetic phenomenon that influences the entire solar system as it passes through. This sheet brings with it not only the potential for a solar micronova but also profound changes in Earth’s magnetic field. The disruption of magnetic fields in the solar system has already been observed on planets like Mars, Venus, and Jupiter, all of which are experiencing dramatic shifts in their atmospheric and magnetic properties【7†source】.

The galactic current sheet, when combined with the solar system's movement through areas of heightened cosmic dust and plasma, acts as a trigger for these events. When Earth's magnetic field reaches a critical point of weakness, it may unlock catastrophic consequences such as a shift in Earth's crust, leading to massive earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. This would explain the mass extinction events and severe climate shifts associated with previous pole reversals.

This is the secular, scientific view of the "threat" we face: not some new and unknown alien menace, but rather a very old and predictable cycle that we are once again approaching.

### **The Religious Perspective: Deception, Division, and Saklas's Plan**

On the spiritual and religious front, the deception we face is far more insidious. The forces of division are not merely political or social; they are deeply spiritual, rooted in a long-standing conflict between truth and falsehood, between unity and fragmentation. In Gnostic traditions, the figure of Saklas (often identified with the Demiurge or the false god of this world) represents the embodiment of deception. Saklas seeks to manipulate humanity by fostering division through organized religion, politics, and the very institutions that people trust for guidance.

Saklas's ultimate goal is to deceive humanity into accepting an apocalyptic narrative where only a "chosen few" are saved. This narrative, which has been perpetuated by certain strands of organized religion, is designed to instill fear and hopelessness, encouraging people to accept division and destruction as inevitable. By creating the illusion of scarcity—whether of resources, salvation, or truth—Saklas ensures that humanity remains fractured and unable to unite against the true threats we face.

This deception is particularly effective because it plays on people's deepest fears: the fear of the unknown, the fear of death, and the fear of being left behind. Throughout history, religious and political leaders have leveraged these fears to control populations, often portraying themselves as the "saviors" who hold the key to salvation. In reality, these leaders are perpetuating Saklas's agenda, which is to keep humanity disempowered and divided.

However, this is not the true message of the prophets, nor of Jesus Christ. Jesus’s teachings were never about division or fear. Instead, He preached a message of universal love, inclusiveness, and unity. His commandment to "love thy neighbor as thyself" was not a suggestion, but a vital key to overcoming the forces of deception that seek to divide us. In Matthew 12:25, Jesus states, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand." This is a profound truth: division weakens us, while unity strengthens us.

Jesus’s message was, and still is, one of unity—across all boundaries, whether racial, social, political, or religious. He warned against the deceptions of false prophets and the dangers of division. His message is not just for Christians or believers, but for all of humanity. In these times of great turmoil, as we approach the end of this cosmic cycle, His teachings on love and unity are more critical than ever.

### **Reagan's Warning: Recognizing a Common Threat**

Former U.S. President Ronald Reagan once made a profound comment during a speech to the United Nations, saying, "Perhaps we need some outside universal threat to make us recognize this common bond. I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world." While Reagan was speaking in the context of Cold War tensions, his words hold even deeper meaning today. The "outside threat" he spoke of is not necessarily an alien invasion, but the cosmic forces at play in the universe that threaten our very existence.

This threat is twofold. From a scientific standpoint, it is the natural cycles of disaster that Earth and the solar system go through, driven by the galactic current sheet, solar micronovae, and magnetic pole reversals. These events have happened before and will happen again. They are part of the cosmic order, and we must be prepared to face them as a united species【7†source】.

From a religious perspective, the threat comes from within, in the form of deception and division. Saklas and the powers that perpetuate falsehoods about salvation, the apocalypse, and the end of the world are leading humanity down a path of destruction. By convincing people that only a select few can survive, they sow division and make it harder for humanity to unite against the real, external threats we face.

### **The Path Forward: Rejecting Deception and Embracing Unity**

We do not need to accept this deception or the division that it creates. Humanity has the power, the knowledge, and the means to unite and face these cosmic threats together. The teachings of Jesus and other prophets have given us the blueprint for overcoming these challenges: through love, unity, and collective action.

We stand at a crossroads. One path leads to division, fear, and destruction—a world where humanity is fractured and powerless to face the coming disasters. The other path leads to unity, empowerment, and survival. By rejecting the false narrative of division and scarcity, we can embrace a future where all of humanity works together to survive and thrive, even in the face of cosmic and environmental upheaval.

Now, more than ever, we must remember Jesus’s message of love and unity. We must look beyond the distractions and deceptions that are being sown around us and recognize the common threats we face—both natural and spiritual. Only by uniting as one can we hope to navigate the challenges ahead and ensure that not just a few, but all of humanity, survives.

The power to change the future is in our hands. Will we allow ourselves to be divided and deceived, or will we rise together, united by love and a shared purpose, to face the cosmic cycles and emerge stronger on the other side? The choice is ours to make, and the time to make it is now.
