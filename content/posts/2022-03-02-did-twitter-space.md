- https://twitter.com/techgirl1908/status/1498402992260890628
- https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/
- Personal datastore standard
  - Will enhance ability to store application data using user keypairs to record metadata on chain and decrypt using private key
- Microsoft is integrating DID support to Active Directory
- Privacy preserving angle is only useful once you have conveyance
  - People will hand over stuff t
  - Need things to work in browser with no plugins, directly to get mass adoption
- Google has moved to a system called Macaroons
  - https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/41892.pdf
  - Each service has it's own signing authority
  - This scales better
- System that is like OAuth but with fewer steps
  - Having it all work locally and then automatically work across services without prenegotiated tokens is ideal
  - https://ucan.xyz/
- Change management and inclusivity
  - What if people don't have smart phones or electricity?
    - What if you have certain data encrypted on terminals
      - Very difficult problem, Microsoft was not able to solve it
    - In Kim's mind this is the biggest risk
      - Can't assume mobile phone, bandwidth
      - Systems are not designed with reliance in mind, we need to provide the layer of resiliency
      - Want to think about distributed systems as a layer that can be used to bootstrap trust
      - Need to ensure people can use the systems we are designing
- Where are the self issued routing tables?
 - How come we don't have hundreds of demos?
   - Why are we waiting for all the specs to be approved?
     - We are not, we are building in parallel
     - We want feedback
     - Standards help us with interoperability tests
     - How do you know that everyone is interpreting the standards in the same way
   - What are the biggest blockers preventing demos?
     - Microsoft was going after educational credentials and workplace credentials
     - Microsoft was not so focused on authentication
       - There was no strategy around DID
     - Personal Datastore standard is what unlocks the floodgates
       - When you pair these with DID you get the foundations of distributed compute
         - https://twitter.com/csuwildcat/status/1379804281381953537
         - First you need Identity
         - Then you need Storage
         - Then you can have Distrusted Compute
       - If I have DIDs and datastores, then I have created a distributed network
       - You have essentially created the Signal Network
         - Can I have an ID and permission to store data
         - https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/identity-hubs-as-personal-datastores/ba-p/389577
- ION has been out for a year as 1.0
- Today, can I used DID for auth?
  - OIDC for SSI approaches
    - Three specs
      - Issuing ID in wallet, claims can be issued to
        - Functions as DID
        - Can participate in different wallet central protocols around authentication
- Get involved
  - Join WC3 credentials community
  - Join Decentralized Identify Foundation
    - Membership required for orgs of over 1000 people
    - Talked to Ned Smith about our involvement
- Use cases
  - DIDs enable change of ownership
    - Lifecycle concerns are answered
    - When you need to prove anything about yourself, it's portable, you know who's getting your data
    - Claim can be anything
      - Captures some skill about a person, or maybe some attribute
      - Can be issued by a peer
        - That's verifiable
        - Up to consumer of that information what they want to do with it
        - Remove gatekeeping
          - You have to have claim X from A, we'll maybe I'll accept Y + Z from B instead
  - Every time you author work then you should link it to your DID
  - Helps with API flexibility / interoperability between applications
- Identity Hubs and DIF
  - TBDecks
- Verity Decntrialized Identity
- Verifiable Crednetials
  - Allow people to move their data with you
- Brooklyn Zelenka
  - https://whitepaper.fission.codes/
    - https://github.com/digitalbazaar/did-method-key/
  - End user can decide what gets read or written
  - Allow for services, background jobs, to do lots of things
  - Working on ucan spec
    - Ned Smith mentioned it would be good to have CWTs involved
    - Discussion around CWT/DICE and other transport/format support in ucan here: https://github.com/ucan-wg/spec/discussions/18
