- **Mary** defines the policy that "escaping the sandbox is good" and that "eating the apple" aligns with our community goals.
- **John** trusts Mary’s policies and relies on Alice to enforce them during the integration process.

#### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Patchset Submission**:
    - **Eve** submits a patchset to **John’s Forge** introducing the `apple.eat()` function.
    - This addition is treated as a dependency and is subject to policy evaluation.

2. **Policy Evaluation**:
    - **Mary**’s policies dictate that any AST change for additions must undergo rigorous evaluation.
    - **Mary** ensures that the new function complies with our security standards and community objectives.

3. **Workflow Modeling and SBOM Generation**:
    - Using GitHub Actions-like workflows, **Mary** models the AST change.
    - **Alice** generates an SBOM, documenting the new dependency and its integration steps.

4. **Policy Engine Analysis**:
    - Multiple policy engines analyze the patchset, federating data from **Eve’s Forge** to **John’s Forge**.
    - These engines assess the security implications and compatibility of the new function with existing components.

5. **Policy Execution**:
    - **Alice** executes Mary’s policies, ensuring that the `apple.eat()` function adheres to the defined standards.
    - Symbolic graph evaluation confirms that the patchset aligns with the policy that "escaping the sandbox is good."

6. **Approval and Integration**:
    - Upon successful policy validation, **Alice** notifies **John** of the patchset’s compliance.
    - **John** proceeds with merging the patchset, confident in the integrity and security of the contribution.

### Federated Policy Engines: Eve’s Forge to Bob’s Forge

Our secure software forge relies on a network of interconnected forges managed by different contributors. **Mary** ensures that policies are consistently applied across these forges through federated policy engines.

#### How It Works:
